"1. Noradrenaline content of several rat brain stem and hypothalamic nuclei falls transiently at 72 h after initiation of renovascular hypertension (one-kidney Goldblatt model). 2. Tyrosine hydroxylase activity is significantly reduced in posterior, paraventricular and periventricular nuclei of hypothalamus at this time but returns to control value by 7 days. 3. Treatment with hydrallazine, 5 mg/kg intraperitoneally, twice daily or methaoxamine, 5 mg/kg, three times daily for 3 days respectively raises and lowers the noradrenaline content of brain nuclei, suggesting that short-term changes in noradrenaline may be secondary to afferent baroreceptor input. 4. At later times after the development of renovascular hypertension (7 and 28 days) activity of phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase is increased in the nucleus of the solitary tract and the locus coeruleus. 5. Brain catecholamines may participate both early in the development and later in the maintenance of renovascular hypertension."
"Dose-response curves of pupillary dilation after topical administration of norepinephrine or methoxamine have been determined in rabbits after chronic inhibition of ocular monoamine oxidase by treatment with pargyline or pheniprazine. Eyes treated with either monoamine oxidase inhibitor showed an enhanced responsiveness to the mydriatic effect of norepinephrine given either topically or intravenously. Increments in pupil size of the treated and control eyes in response to methoxamine applied topically, on the other hand, were the same. These results suggest that monoamine oxidase may play a role in the iris as one factor influencing the concentration of norepinephrine at the receptors."
"Clonidine (ip) and methoxamine (ivc) inhibit the catalepsy produced by haloperidol or fluphenazine. Naphazoline and xylometazoline antagonize the catalepsy produced by haloperidol, but do not affect significantly that produced by fluphenazine. Phenylephrine did not affect the catalepsy produced by either neuroleptic. The results indicate that drugs stimulating central noradrenergic receptors antagonize the action of compounds blocking the central dopaminergic receptors."
"The effect of naloxone in vitro, on noradrenaline (NA)-induced responses in guinea-pig isolated vas deferens was studied. The responses of NA were potentiated by naloxone (3 microM). It potentiated the responses to methoxamine which has least affinity for uptake sites. Responses induced by acetylcholine and potassium chloride were also potentiated by naloxone. Low calcium (0.8 mM) in the medium antagonized the potentiating action of naloxone. It is suggested that naloxone produces non-specific potentiation, by promoting calcium influx at the post-synaptic site."
"A variety of alpha-adrenergic agonists encompassing a broad range of concentrations were used to investigate the existence and nature of a putative alpha-adrenergic mechanism inhibitory to renin release, which may operate at the level of the juxtaglomerular apparatus. For this purpose rat renal cortical tissue incubated in vitro was used. Concentrations of noradrenaline, adrenaline and methoxamine of 10(-6), 10(-5), 10(-4) and 10(-3) M caused significant dose-related inhibition of renin release. The inhibition of release by these doses was reversed completely by 10(-4) M phentolamine. In contrast, phenylephrine, oxymetazoline and clonidine did not inhibit renin release. The results support the concept of an alpha-adrenergic mechanism inhibitory to renin release and show that high concentrations of alpha-adrenergic agonist are required for its operation in vitro. The manner in which this inhibitory mechanism affects renin release under physiological circumstances remains to be demonstrated."
"A standard rabbit thoracic-aorta strip preparation was used to determine the effect of varying preload on KA(the dissociation constant), A50(the concentration that produces half maximal response) and the ratio KA/A50. Additionally, the stimulus-response relationships were obtained for the drug and preload conditions tested. Values of KA and A50 were calculated from dose-response curves obtained for three alpha-adrenergic agonists (phenylephrine, methoxamine and norepinephrine) in the presence and absence of partial irreversible blockade by phenoxybenzamine. For all three drugs, values of KA and A50 were found to be significantly greater at 1/4 gram preload than at 10 gram preload. However, the ratio KA/A50 was found to be independent of preload conditions. The stimulus-response relationships were all found to be non-linear, in contrast to the predictions of classical receptor theory. The significance of the constancy of KA/A50, rather than either KA or A50, and the non-linear relation between drug stimulus and response is discussed in terms of Stephenson's theory of drug action."
"Recent evidence suggests that of calcitonin (CT) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) is controlled by factors other than the ambient serum calcium concentration. We studied the effects of infusions of four neuroendocrine modulators upon CT and PTH levels: isoproterenol (beta-adrenergic agonist), methoxamine (alpha adrenergic agonist), prostaglandin E2, and somatostatin. Isoproterenol was a consistent secretagogue for both hormones. Maximal CT increments during isoproterenol infusion in normal subjects were 13 +/- 2 pg/ml (mean +/- SEM, n = 6, P less than 0.001; basal, 26 +/- 5). Maximal increments in PTH were 113 +/- 22 pg/ml (P less than 0.01, n = 6; basal, 430 +/- 11). Infusions of methoxamine increased CT by 13 +/- 5 pg/ml (n = 5, P less than 0.05; basal, 43 +/- 13), but had no effect on PTH. The means of the maximal CT increments during isoproterenol (21 +/- 8 pg/ml) and methoxamine infusion (28 +/- 11 pg/ml) were not statistically different from those achieved by acute elevations of serum calcium levels within the physiological range (41 +/- 23 pg/ml). Infusions of somatostatin and prostaglandin E2 had no or only transient effects on basal or stimulated CT or PTH levels. Our data suggest that adrenergic input modulates CT and PTH secretion in humans independently of changes in serum calcium."
"The mechanism by which clonidine suppresses renin release was investigated in conscious rats. This suppression was studied by means of selected autonomic interventions in conjunction with changes in sodium balance. Serum renin activity and direct arterial pressure were monitored. Clonidine administration suppressed basal (by 68-85\%), diuretic-induced (by 89\%), and sympathetic nervous system-mediated (by 75-100\%) renin release. Cholinergic, ganglionic, and peripheral sympathetic neuronal blockade did not prevent this inhibitory effect of clonidine. These results indicate a peripheral site of action for suppression of renin release by clonidine. The alpha-adrenergic blocking drug phentolamine prevented clonidine suppression of renin release in sodium-depleted rats and was partially effective in normal rats. Phentolamine blocked the decrease in renin caused by clonidine in ganglion-blocked rats. Clozapine, a new neuroleptic agent with alpha-adrenergic blocking activity, or phenoxybenzamine blocked the effect of clonidine on renin release in both sodium-depleted and normal rats. After ganglionic blockade in sodium-depleted rats, clonidine caused a significantly greater suppression of renin release than did an equipressor dose of methoxamine. These data, combined with hemodynamic correlates, suggest that clonidine inhibits renin release by activation of an intrarenal alpha-adrenergic receptor."
"Tha alpha-sympathomimetic agonists, clonidine, naphazoline, methoxamine, oxymetazoline and phenylephrine were used to further characterize the alpha-adrenoceptors mediating the positive inotropic effect in the isolated papillary muscle of the rabbit heart. The maximal inotropic effects of these amines were compared with the effect of isoprenaline and it was examined whether or not these amines compete for alpha-adrenoceptors. On the papillary muscle stimulated at 0.5 Hz, phenylephrine showed a high affinity (pD2 value=6.13) and produced the most pronounced intrinsic activity of the alpha-sympathomimetic amines. Therefore, the intrinsic activity of phenylephrine, in the presence of prindolol (3 X 10(-8) M), was used for comparison with those of the other alpha-agonists. Clonidine caused a positive inotropic effect: the intrinsic activity amounted to 0.32 of that of phenylephrine; the affinity was the highest among the amines tested (pD2 value=6.46); its effect was inhibited by 10(-6) M phentolamine. The affinity and the intrinsic activity of naphazoline were slightly lower than those of clonidine. Methoxamine showed a relatively high intrinsic activity (0.56) but the lowest affinity (4.68). Oxymetazoline did not cause any positive inotropic effect. Clonidine, naphazoline and oxymetazoline antagonized the positive inotropic effect of phenylephrine, mediated via the alpha-adrenocaptors in the presence of 3 X 10(-8) M prindolol, in a competitive manner. This observation suggests that these alpha-sympathomimetic amines compete with phenylephrine for the same receptor site. Thus the present results provide additional evidence for alpha-adrenoceptors mediating the positive inotropic actions of sympathomimetic amines in the rabbit papillary muscle."
"The effect of adrenergic blocking and stimulating agents on arginine vasotocin (AVT) release from the neurohpophysis following osmotic stimuli was studied in hens. It was found that alpha - adrenergic blocking drug - regitine inhibits the release of AVT after the intravenous injection of hypertonic solution of NaCl. The alpha - adrenergic stimulating drug - vasoxine as well as beta - adrenergic blocking drug - propranolol and beta - stimulating drug isoprenalinsulphate had no effect on the release of AVT."
"The cardiovascular alpha adrenergic receptors evoke vasoconstriction, the cardiovascular beta receptors evoke vasodilation and cardiac stimulation. All blood vessels have both alpha and beta receptors. In some areas, for example skin and kidney, the alpha receptors predominate. In some vascular beds, for example the nutrient vessels in skeletal muscle, beta receptors predominate. In other beds, such as coronary, visceral, and connective tissue both receptors are active. The cardiovascular effects of adrenergic agonists depend on which receptor they act on. Phenylephrine is specific for alpha receptors. Isoproterenol is specific for beta receptors. Epinephrine and norepinephrine act on both. The real value of knowing the receptor specificity of each agonist is that side effects can more easily be predicted. For example, adrenergic cardiac stimulants are antiasthmatics. Therefore, adrenergic antiasthmatics can produce excessive cardiac stimulation. For the future, agonists that are not only receptor-specific but also tissue-specific will be developed. The first of these in the United States is terbutaline. The rest of the world has in addition a similar drug, salbutamol. No one knows if this drug will be approved for use by American physicians."
"Propranolol markedly increased the norepinephrine-induced maximal force in circular smooth muscle of the rat portal, mesenteric, renal and, to a lesser extent, femoral veins without affecting aortic or mesenteric artery responses to norepinephrine. Furthermore, two other beta receptor antagonists, practolol and N-isopropylmethoxamine, specifically enhanced maximal venous responses to norepinephrine. Contractions to norepinephrine, but not to serotonin, were increased by propranolol only in veins, even after the vasodilator, papaverine. The ability of propranolol to enhance norepinephrine-induced contraction in these rat veins paralleled the effectiveness of isoproterenol to relax such tissues. In addition, beta receptor antagonists enhanced the response of veins to the field stimulated release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerves. These data support the conclusion that beta adrenergic stimulation modulates norepinephrine-induced constriction in certain rat veins but not in the aorta or mesenteric artery."
"Experiments were designed to investigate responses of immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (PTH) during alpha-adrenergic stimulation and blockade in cows. Alpha-adrenergic agonists (methoxamine, phenylephrine and noradrenaline, the beta-adrenergic action of which was blocked by propranolol) did not change PTH and free fatty acid levels, whereas they characteristically increased the blood pressure and decreased the heart rate. In contrast, alpha-adrenergic blockade by phentolamine progressively increased PTH levels. The elevated PTH concentrations, associated with increased plasma noradrenaline and free fatty acid levels, rising heart rate and decreasing blood pressure, indicated that all these changes can be related to a beta-adrenergic stimulatory mechanism. Beta-adrenergic stimulation was presumably responsible for the initial elevation of PTH concentrations, whereas, during the later phase of the phentolamine infusions, a concomitant hypocalcaemia probably also produced a stimulatory effect."
"1 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) contracted isolated saphenous vein strips of the dog, producing a biphasic concentration-effect curve. The first phase occurred with low concentrations of 5-HT (1.0 X 10(-8) TO 5.0 X 10(-6) mol/l) with a plateau between 1.0 x 10(-6) mol/l and 1.0 x 10(-5) mol/l. The second phase occurred with high concentrations of 5-HT (greater than 1.0 x 10(-5) mol/l). 2 The alpha-adrenoceptor antabonists, phentolamine (5.0 x 10(-8) to 5.0 x 10(-7) mol/l), labetalol (1.0 x 10(-6) to 1.0 x 10(-5) mol/l) and thymoxamine (1.0 x 10(-6) to 1.0 x 10(-5) mol/l), antagonized responses to high concentrations of 5-HT but responses to low concentrations of 5-HT were not antagonized. 3 The effects of high concentrations of 5-HT were antagonized by cocaine (1.0 x 10(-6) to 1.0 x 10(-5) mol/l) and were not evident in veins removed from dogs pretreated with syrosingopine. 5-HT receptors and that high concentrations of 5-HT also act indirectly on alpha-adrenoceptors by displacing noradrenaline from neuronal stores."
"1 The pharmacological characteristics of adrenoceptors mediating the positive inotropic action in the dog heart were assessed by the use of blood-perfused papillary muscles and isolated strips of ventricular myocardium.2 On the blood-perfused papillary muscle driven at 2 Hz and in sinus node preparations, phenylephrine induced positive inotropic and chronotropic responses in the same dose range and was much less potent than isoprenaline. The dose-response curve for the chronotropic action of phenylephrine was parallel to that of isoprenaline, whilst the dose-response curve for the inotropic action of phenylephrine was less steep than that of isoprenaline.3 The infusion of pindolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, at a rate of 1 mug/min, shifted the isoprenaline dose-response curves to the right, and to the same extent, in both papillary muscle and sinus node preparations. In contrast to isoprenaline, the antagonism of phenylephrine by pindolol was noncompetitive. Phentolamine did not affect the positive inotropic and chronotropic actions of phenylephrine.4 On isolated ventricular strips alpha-adrenoceptor blockade by 10(-6) M phentolamine did not affect dose-response curves to phenylephrine or dopamine. Pindolol shifted the dopamine dose-response curves to the right in a competitive manner and those of phenylephrine in a noncompetitive manner.5 On ventricular strips from reserpine-pretreated dogs phenylephrine and tyramine dose-response curves were shifted markedly to the right and downwards. Desipramine (10(-5) M) which enhanced the action of noradrenaline considerably reduced the myocardial responses of phenylephrine.6 Papaverine (10(-5) M) decreased the threshold concentration of phenylephrine required to stimulate the myocardium and shifted phenylephrine dose-response curves to the left.7 Raising the temperature from 32 degrees C to 37 degrees C shifted phenylephrine dose-response curves to the right; when the temperature was raised from 37 degrees C to 42 degrees C the affinity of the drug was not changed.8 Other alpha-adrenoceptor stimulants, methoxamine and clonidine, decreased the active tension of ventricular strips. The responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline (in the presence of pindolol; 3 x 10(-8) M) were not affected by phentolamine (10(-6) M).9 The results indicate that adrenoceptors mediating positive inotropic responses in the dog ventricle are of the beta-type and that post-synaptic alpha-adrenoceptors are not involved. Phenylephrine acts mainly by releasing noradrenaline from adrenergic nerve endings and partly by a weak direct action on beta-adrenoceptors."
"The chronotropic effects of midodrine, glycine (10(-8) to 3.10(-3) M), ST1059 and methoxamine (10(-8) to 10(-3) M) were investigated in the spontaneously beating guinea-pig right atrial preparation. Midodrine and glycine produced a slight, but significant rise in atrial rate over a wide concentration range. The midodrine-induced rise in atrial rate was not influenced by the beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drug propranolol (10(-6) M). The histamine (H2)-receptor blocking drug metiamide (3.10(-5) M) abolished the positive chronotropic actions of both midodrine and glycine. No positive chronotropic effect was seen after the administration of ST 1059 or methoxamine. A decrease in atrial rate was elicited by high concentrations (above 10(-4) to 10(-3) M) of the sympathomimetic agents midodrine, ST 1059, and methoxamine, but not by the amino acid glycine."
"The midpontine decerebrate dog, immobilized with gallamine, was used to determine the changes in the transcallosally evoked potential (TEP) produced by intravenous infusions of various drugs. A total of 50 TEPs, recorded from the g. ectolateralis, was computer analyzed before, during and after administration of the drugs. Changes in the TEP were also correlated with changes in the EEG recorded from the g. ectolateralis. The EEG was analyzed by inspection and amplitude integration (electrogenesis). LSD (30 microng/kg) significantly depressed the TEP, and the effect persisted for at least 80 min. DMT (1 mg/kg) caused a significant and reversible increase in the amplitude of the TEP. LSD and DMT reduced the alpha activity of the EEG and enhanced the amplitude of the low-frequency waves. DMT produced a significant and LSD a marginal increase in electrogenesis. Tryptamine (10 and 20 mg/kg), mescaline (6 mg/kg), methoxamine (0.88 mg/kg) and apomorphine (5 mg/kg) had no significant effect on the TEP or EEG. These results suggest that depression of the TEP is not related to spinal reflex facilitation in the dog or hallucinogenic activity in man."
"End-systolic pressure (PES), volume (VES), wall tension (TES) and circumference (CES) of the human left ventricle were studied at cardiac catheterization in 24 subjects with varying degrees of left ventricular dysfunction. Acute alterations in systolic load consistently resulted in changes in VES and CES, with a smaller volume and circumference characterizing the lower systolic load in each subject. End systolic pressure-volume lines were constructed by plotting PES against VES at the higher and lower systolic load in each subject. The slope of the resultant lines was considerably steeper for normal than for poorly contractile left ventricles. Vo, the volume axis intercept of the line (i.e., the theoretical VES at PES = O) was significantly smaller for normal than for poorly contractile ventricles. Similar findings were noted for Co, the theoretic end-systolic circumference at zero end-systolic ventricular wall tension. Post-extrasystolic potentiation resulted in decreased VES and CES with no change in PES and only a slight fall in TES. In conclusion, end-systolic pressure-volume and tension-circumference relations reflect the contractile state of left ventricular myocardium. Quantitation of these relationships may provide a useful new approach to the assessment of myocardial function in man."
"The effect of norepinephrine on compound 48/80-induced histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells, was studied in an in vitro system. It was found that norepinephrine, within the concentration range 10(-5)--10(-3) M, exerts a significant, dose-related, repressive effect. This effect is greatly potentiated by the beta-antagonist practolol (10(-3) M), throughout the concentration range of 10(-11)--10(-3) M norepinephrine. Methoxyamine, a selective alpha-adrenergic agonist, also represses histamine release in a dose-dependent manner; however, it is not as potent as norepinephrine. The present results would seem to suggest that the repressive effect on histamine release, observed within a low concentration range of norepinephrine, may be due to alpha-adrenoceptor mechanisms."
"In this study the role of cyclic AMP in the antilpolytic effect of the alpha-adrenergic agents methoxamine and phenylephrine in hamster epididymal adipocytes was studied. Both methozamine and phenylephrine lowered the very high levels of cyclic AMP that were produced by high concentrations of isoproterenol (10 muM) or ACTH (100 MU/ml), and partially inhibited lipolysis. When lower concentrations of isoproterenol were used, the antilipolytic effect of phenylephrine and methoxamine was still evident. Under these conditions methoxamine produced a slight suppression of cyclic AMP levels while phenylephrine increased accumulation of cyclic AMP. It follows, therefore, that the inhibition of lipolysis by the alpha agents is most likely unrelated to changes in cyclic AMP levels; in contrast, phenylephrine promoted lipolysis and increased cyclic AMP levels. When the stimulus for lipolysis was provided by methylxanthines a different picture emerged. Methoxamine antagonized lipolysis and lowered cyclic AMP levels. In the presence of propranolol, phenylephrine lowered cyclic AMP levels and suppressed methylxanthine-accelerated lipolysis. It is suggested that when methy xanthines provide the stimulus for lipolysis the antilipolytic effect of methoxamine and phenylephrine (in the presence of propranolol) may be mediated by the suppression in cyclic AMP levels."
"Transmural creatine kinase activity was determined 5 hours after acute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery in 27 open chest anesthetized dogs. In seven dogs, propranolol, 2 mg/kg, was given intravenously over a 10 minute period 10 minutes after occlusion. In 10 dogs, nitroglycerin, 300 microgram/min, was infused intravenously for 1 hour 10 minutes after occlusion. Methoxamine, 300 to 500 microgram, was administered to return blood pressure and heart rate to prenitroglycerin levels. In untreated dogs, there was a distinct transmural gradient of creatine kinase activity in the ischemic region from subepicardium to subendocardium: nonischemic subepicardium 1,187 +/- 50 international units (IU)/g versus ischemic subepicardium 1,054 +/- 46 IU/g and nonischemic subendocardium 1,170 +/- 53 IU/g versus ischemic subendocard;um 766 +/- 42 IU/g, respectively. Administration of propranolol did not affect the transmural creatine kinase gradient after 5 hours of occlusion. In contrast, nitroglycerin plus methoxamine significantly (P less than 0.05) decreased subendocardial creatine kinase depletion after 5 hours of occlusion (776 +/- 42 versus 978 +/- 47 IU/g). These findings demonstrate the unique capability of nitroglycerin plus methoxamine to protect the subendocardium during ischemic insult."
"The effect of hypertonic mannitol on pressor responses to vasoactive agents was studied in isolated canine coronary arteries perfused with physiologic salt solution at a constant flow. When perfusion pressure was increased with 60 mM KCl, mannitol (50 mosM) consistently caused a decrease in perfusion pressure that lasted for at least 1 h. Withdrawal of mannitol from the perfusion media was associated with a vasoconstrictor response that was not prevented by alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor blockade or by the presence of either nitroglycerin or norepinephrine. Hypertonic mannitol also reduced the responsiveness of the isolated smooth muscle preparations to several different mechanistically unrelated vasodilator agents. The mechanism(s) responsible for the paradoxical ability of hypertonic mannitol to reduce vascular responsiveness to both vasoconstrictor and vasodilator interventions in isolated canine coronary arteries is not known, but future studies should be directed at elucidating it as well as determining whether similar phenomena occur in vivo."
"The haemodynamic effects of intravenous Methoxamine were studied in 8 patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) with mitral incompetence (group I) and 8 patients with mitral incompetence due to valvular, subvalvular or other causes (group II). In both groups the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure rose significantly without any great change in the end diastolic surface area: the ventricular distensibility is reduced in both cases. The mean capillary pressure, the V wave/mean capillary pressure ratio, and the degree of regurgitation of the two groups changed in opposite ways : in mitral incompetence due to varying causes (group II) the regurgitation increased, but in mitral incompetence due to HOCM (group I), it decreased. The left ventricular intracavitary gradient in HOCM tended to disappear under the effect of Methoxamine as the systolic aortic pressure approached the basal values recorded in the apical area."
"An analysis of 2,394 selective coronary angiograms yielded 23 examples of coronary artery spasm. Of these, nine occurred in patients with Prinzmetal's variant angina and 14 were instances of catheter-induced spasm. Angiographic criteria can distinguish between the spasm of variant angina and catheter-induced spasm. The latter is usually asymptomatic, almost invariably in the right coronary artery, at the catheter tip, smooth, concentric, and less than 2 mm long. The former can occur in any coronary artery at a distance of 1--4 cm from the catheter tip, is usually irregular and eccentric, and is associated with angina, ST segment elevation, hypotension, and dysrhythmia. Response to nitroglycerin is often, but not always, complete in both. Stenoses that seem to be fixed in patients with Prinzmetal's angina should be suspected to be spasm even if unresponsive to nitroglycerin, especially when the rest of the vessel is normal. Additional pharmacologic manipulation and even recatheterization may be necessary to prove the dynamic nature of the lesion and avoid unnecessary surgery."
"The blood flow through the anterior wall of the left ventricle has been studied during electrical stimulation of the left stellate ganglion of anesthetized dogs. The flow was continuously monitored by heated cross-thermocuple. Ganglion stimulation caused a significant increase in the flow through the outer half while producing relative ischemia of the inner half of the wall. Pretreatment with propranolol reduced regional difference of flow changes. Significantly augmented non-uniform flow changes, however, were produced by ganglion stimulation during hypertension caused by aortic constriction or by methoxamine. The results indicate non-uniform blood flow distribution which can be produced by sympathetic nerve excitation."
"Eight mongrel dogs exercised for 8 weeks by treadmill running at 20 per cent incline 20 to 25 minutes twice daily, 4-5 days/week. Another eight dogs which were kept in the cages for a similar period served as controls. The exercise program was effective in inducing myocardial hypertrophy since the ratio left ventricular weight/body weight was significantly (P less than 0.001) higher in the trained dogs (5.04 g/kg) than in the sedentary animals (3.83 g/kg). In morphine-chloralose anesthesia the dogs were studied by left heart catherization and cineangiography at spontaneous heart rate (run I), at paced heart rate (run II), at paced heart rate following cardiac autonomic nervous blockade by bilateral vagotomy and the administration of propranolol (run III) and during acute pressure loading with methoxzmine at constant heart rate (run IV). Intergroup comparison yielded no significant difference in any hemodynamic or volumetric parameter throughout the entire study. However, with intragroup comparisons between run III and run IV a less significant increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (from 5 to 15 mm Hg; P less than 0.05) was observed in the trained animals than in the control dogs (from 6 to 25 mm Hg; P less than 0.001). Left ventricular end-diastolic volume increased significantly only in the control dogs during acute pressure loading. Mean aortic pressure and left ventricular peak dP/dt increased to a similar extent in both groups. Since in the trained dogs the left ventricle encroaches less on the Frank-Starling mechanism than in normal animals for overcoming an acute pressure burden it is concluded that the development of hypertrophy concomitant with chronic exercise represents an adaptive mechanism with evidence of beneficial consequences for the intrinsic contractile function of the myocardium."
"Earlier investigations of sympathomimetic drugs overcoming the amnesic action of cycloheximide (CXM) in day-old chickens were extended to biochemical studies in vitro. The effects of amphetamine, norepinephrine, alpha and beta noradrenergic stimulants and receptor blockers on Na+/K+ ATP'ase activity in total homogenate of chicken forebrain were investigated. Norepinephrine and the beta stimulant, isoprenaline significantly stimulated the activity of this enzyme, while the beta blocker, propranolol inhibited activity. Amphetamine, the alpha stimulant, methoxamine and the alpha receptor blocker, piperoxane had no effect  on Na/K+ ATP'ase activity in total homogenate. In a purified synaptosomal preparation, both amphetamine (5 X 10(-5) M) and norepinephrine (1 X 10(-4) M) produced a slight stimulation of Na+/K+ ATP'ase activity. A similar concentration of amphetamine (1.12 X 10(-4) M) did not inhibit 14C-leucine uptake or incorporation into protein in the synaptosomal fraction. Nor was it able to alleviate CXM inhibition of 14C-leucine incorporation into synaptosomal protein. The results are interpreted in terms of amphetamine (via release of norepinephrine) norepinephrine and isoprenaline stimulating and maintaining the labile, sodium pump-dependent, phase of memory formation for a sufficient length of time until protein synthesis inhibition by CXM wears off."
"Experimental contraction was produced in the rat mesenteric arteries and the arterial segments were studied morphologically. When the rat mesenteric artery was exposed in physiological saline solution at 37 degrees C and 2-3 mg of methoxamine hydrochloride (10 mg/ml) was dripped onto it, intense contraction was observed for about 30 min but elevation in blood pressure was slight. During the contraction, numerous vacuoles were seen in the medial smooth muscle cells of the arterial segments, and these vacuoles were shown electron microscopically to have double unit membranes, indicating that they were formed by herniation of a part of the adjacent smooth muscle cell body. In the arteries 1-6 h after the end of the contraction, cellular, nuclear and vacuolar membranes and myofilaments of the medial muscle cells were partially lost. 12-24 h after the contraction the arteries exhibited necrosis and desquamation of endothelial cells and platelet adhesion. In the media, smooth muscle cells were completely deprived of cell membranes, myofilaments, nuclei, intracytoplasmic organelles other than mitochondria, and vacuolar membranes. The cytoplasm was filled with fine granular and granulo-vesicular material, and fibrin insudation was observed in these severely damaged cells. Arterial contraction may be an important factor in the induction of arterial lesions."
"The effects of verapamil on myocardial isometric force on contraction, cardiac adenosine 3,'5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and heart phosphorylase alpha activity were studied in the isolated perfused rat heart. When hearts were perfused with verapamil (5.98 times 10- minus 8 M), force of contraction was reduced approximately 50\% within 4 to 5 minutes; at this point, the concentration of cyclic AMP was significantly lower than control but phosphorylase alpha activity was unchanged. In hearts perfused continuously for 60 minutes with verapamil, force of contraction and cyclic AMP levels returned to normal within 20 minutes after administration of verapamil was begun. Isoproterenol (0.355 nmol/min) reversed the depressant effect of verapamil on cardiac contractility and restored heart cyclic AMP levels to normal. Methoxamine (35.5 nmol/min) given to verapamil-depressed hearts, caused contractile force to return to normal, but cardiac cyclic AMP levels remained low. Mephentermine (23.0 nmol/min) had no effect on cardiac contraction, cyclic AMP or phosphorylase alpha activity in hearts depressed by verapamil. It was concluded that with the concentration of verapamil used in these experiments, the drug caused a transient decrease in force of contraction and myocardial cyclic AMP. Both the depression in myocardial contractility and in cardiac cyclic AMP caused by verapamil were reversed promptly by isoproterenol, whereas methoxamine overcame acutely only the negative inotropic effect of verapamil. Mephentermine had no effect on hearts depressed by verapamil."
"In the isolated papillary muscle of the rabbit the time course of the effects of selective beta- and alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation by isoprenaline and methoxamine, respectively, on the contractile force and on the level of 3',5'-cyclic AMP (cAMP) was determined. 1. Isoprenaline (3 times 10(-7) M) increased significantly the content of cAMP at 15 sec and elevated it to the maximal level-about twice the control value-at 30 sec after its administration, while the developed tension of the papillary muscle was also increased significantly at 15 sec and reached gradually its maximum at 90 sec. 2. Compared with isoprenaline methoxamine (10(-4) M) increased the developed tension very slowly: the maximal response was reached after 20 min. The level of cAMP, on the other hand, was changed neither before nor during the induction of the positive inotropic effect of methoxamine. 3. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor papaverine (10(-5) M) inhibited the PDE activity of the papillary muscle by about 40\% after an incubation of 1 hr, and increased the level of cAMP significantly. The effects of isoprenaline on the contractile forced and on the level of cAMP were considerably enhanced by papaverine: the content of cAMP was increased by isoprenaline (3 times 10(-7) M) to about 3 times the control value and also its positive inotropic effect was significantly greater than in controls without papaverine. On the other hand, the positive inotropic effect of methoxamine (10(-4) M) was not affected by papaverine (10(-5) M). Furthermore, in the papillary muscle treated with papaverine the level of cAMP was significantly reduced by methoxamine: the papaverine-induced increase of cAMP was abolished by methoxamine. 4. The present results are compatible with the hypothesis that cAMP is involved as a mediator in the positive inotropic effect induced by beta-adrenoceptor stimulation, and indicate further that the stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors evokes its positive inotropic effec through a mechanism other than that elicited by beta-adrenoceptor stimulation, i.e., independent of cAMP."
"Amylase secretion and changes in the levels of cyclic AMP and GMP were studied in rabbit parotid gland slices incubated in vitro with a variety of neurohumoral transmitters, their analogs and inhibitors. Cyclic GMP levels increased 8-fold 5 min after exposure to carbachol (10(-4) M), without a change in cyclic AMP levels; amylase output also rose. These effects were completely inhibited by muscarinic blockade with atropine, but were unaffected by alpha-adrenergic blockade with phenoxybenzamine. Epinephrine (4 - 10(-5) M) produced a rapid increase in the levels of both cyclic nucleotides and in amylase release. The increase in cyclic GMP level was inhibited by previous exposure of the slices to phenoxybenzamine, while the cyclic AMP rise was prevented by the beta-blocking agent, propranolol. Pure alpha-adrenergic stimulation with methoxamine (4 - 10(-4) M) produced modest elevations in cyclic GMP content and amylase output, effects blocked by pre-treatment of slices with either atropine or phenoxybenzamine. At a concentration of 4 - 10(-6) M, isoproterenol (a beta-agonist) failed to affect cyclic GMP levels, but promptly stimulated increases in cyclic AMP levels, and after a short lag, amylase secretion. At a higher dose (4 - 10(-5) M) isoproterenol produced elevations in the levels of both nucleotides. The carbachol-induced effects on cyclic GMP content and amylase release were greatly potentiated by the addition of isoproterenol (4 - 10(-6) M). These data strongly suggest that cholinergic muscarinic agonists and alpha-adrenergic agonists stimulate amylase output in rabit parotid gland by mechanisms involving cyclic GMP. The atropine-sensitive intracellular events effected by alpha-stimulation may be dependent upon endogenous generation of acetylcholine. Both cyclic nucleotides seem to be required for the early rapid secretion of amylase. The unique responses achieved by the combination of carbachol and isoproterenol suggest that isoproterenol may increase the sensitivity of this tissue to the effects of cholinergic stimuli."
"The effect of verapamil on myocardial contractility, heart adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and cardiac phosphorylase a activity was studied in isolated perfused rat hearts. In a concentration of 0.025 mug/ml, verapamil decreased force of contraction 50\% and caused a significant fall in heart cyclic AMP within 4 to 5 min after perfusion with the drug was begun. When perfusion of the heart with medium containing verapamil was continued for 60 min, contractile force gradually returned to control. at the end of 60 min of perfusion with verapamil, the myocardial concentration of cyclic AMP was not different from that measured in hearts perfused with contro medium for a similar time period. Isoproterenol, given at the point of maximal contractile depression induced by verapamil, restored normal force of contraction and raised cardiac cyclic AMP to the same level as that observed when the catecholamine was given to untreated hearts; When methoxamine was administered to hearts depressed by verapamil, contractility returned to normal, but cyclic AMP content remained below control values."
"The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of methoxamine on force development and adenyl cyclase activity in cat ventricular myocardium. Methoxamine produced a dose-related increase in force development of isometrically contracting cat papillary muscles. The positive inotropic effects of methoxamine were not altered by beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol), or catecholamine depletion by prior reserpinization, but were completely prevented by alpha-adrenergic blockade (phentolamine or ergotamine). Neither ergotamine, phentolamine, nor methoxamine had any direct effects on adenyl cyclase activity. Phentolamine did not attenuate the increase in force development produced by paired electrical stimulation, suggesting that it does not block the entry of calcium into the muscle. In summary, methoxamine produced a dose-related increase in force development of the cat papillary muscle that was selectively blocked by alpha-adrenergic receptors in ventricular myocardium."
"Oxidation of [14C] glucose in isolated epididymal adipocytes from Golden hamsters was stimulated by isoproterenol, epinephrine and norepinephrine, which all interact with beta-adrenergic receptors and by adrenocorticotrophic hormone. In contrast alpha-receptor agonists, such as phenylephrine, methoxamine or clonidine did not increase basal glucose oxidation. The beta-adrenergic blocking drug propranolol inhibited both lipolysis and glucose oxidation when these had been stimulated by isoproterenol, epinephrine or norepinephrine. Conversely, the alpha-adrenergic blocking drugs phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine did not influence lipolysis or glucose oxidation when isoproterenol provided the stimulus and increased both lipolysis and glucose metabolism in the present of either epinephrine or norepinephrine. All alpha-adrenergic agonists tested (phenylephrine, methoxamine and clonidine) lowered lipolysis and glucose oxidation isolated adipocytes exposed to isoproterenol. However, when adrenocorticotropin provided the stimulus for glucose oxidation and lipolysis, only clonidine produced a significant reduction in lipolysis and glucose oxidation. None of the alpha-agonists influenced glucose metabolism which had been increased by insulin. These data confirm the presence of both alpha and beta adrenergic receptors on hamster epididymal adipocytes and suggest that they exert antagonistic influences on lipolysis and glucose oxidation. These data are also consistent with the view that adrenergic stimulation of glucose oxidation and lipolysis in adipocytes are both mediated through beta receptors."
"(1) The metabolism of phosphatidylinositol has been investigated in heart fragments and aorta slices incubated with adrenergic agonists. (2) Noradrenaline and isoprenaline had no stimulatory effect on 32Pi incorporation into phosphatidylinositol in cat and guinea-pig hearts. (3) Incorporation of 32Pi into phosphatidylinositol was enhanced by noradrenaline and methoxamine in cat aorta. (4) This information is consistent with the idea that the enhanced phosphatidylinositol turnover produced during adrenergic stimulation is mediated through alpha-adrenergic receptors and not through beta-adrenoceptors."
"Noradrenaline as well as the indirectly acting amines tyramine and phenethylamine either enhance or inhibit the twitch response of the transmurally stimulated, isolated guine-pig vas deferens, thus partly confirming previous reports. In both cases enhancement is annulled by alpha-adrenoceptor blockers. The twitch inhibition caused by noradrenaline is abolished by alpha- + beta2-adrenoceptor blockers, but not by either blocker alone. The inhibition caused by the indirectly acting amines is largely abolished by alpha-adrenoceptor blockers. Clonidine strongly inhibits the twitch. This effect if promptly removed by phentolamine. After blockade of the neurally induced twitch by tetrodotoxin, noradrenaline and the indirectly acting amines have no effect or slightly enhance the twitch elicited by transmural stimulation of the smooth muscle. It is concluded that exogenous noradrenaline acts on postjunctional stimulatory alpha-adrenoceptors and on inhibitory alpha- and beta2-adrenoceptors, which are presumably prejunctional. In the unstimulated preparation contracted by acetylcholine, noradrenaline causes further contraction which is changed into relaxation after phentolamine. This relaxation is abolished by butoxamine, suggesting that noradrenaline may also act on inhibitory postjunctional beta2-adrenoceptors. The twitch-inhibiting effect of endogenous noradrenaline, released by nerve stimulation or by indirectly acting amines, appears to be primarily mediated by prejunctional alpha-adrenoceptors."
"In order to clarify the mechanism of the different sensitivity of the adrenoceptors between normal and hypothyroid rats, cyclic AMP levels in the liver and heart were measured after the administration of phenylephrine, isoproterenol, epinephrine and methoxamine. Cyclic AMP increased in all cases, but the extent of its increment in the heart was much less than that in the liver. Phentolamine and propranolol showed only a partial inhibition of cyclic AMP elevation by the agonists in the liver from normal and hypothyroid rat. On the other hand, propranolol blocked completely the effect of the agonists on the heart from both groups. It was also observed that cyclic AMP increased in adrenalectomized rats after the injection of the adrenergic agonists. The basal activity of protein kinase in hypothyroid status was slightly lower than that in the normal, but this enzyme was stimulated in the presence of cyclic AMP in vitro. These results suggest that the function of beta-adrenoceptor remained normal even in hypothyroidism and responded well to isoproterenol and epinephrine. It is also indicated that the increased sensitivity of alpha-adrenoceptor to phenylephrine in the hy pothyroid atria previously observed is probably in part independent of the mechanism mediated by cyclic AMP."
"Intraventricular infusions of methoxamine, an adrenergic agonist that has a relatively low affinity for the presynaptic uptake mechanism, produces a significant dose-dependent increase in locomotor activity comparable to the increase elicited by infusion of equimolar doses of norepinephrine (NE). The behavioral responsiveness to infusion of both NE and methoxamine was more than doubled 3 weeks after pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). These results indicate that the increased responsiveness to NE induced by 6-OHDA is due to enhanced postsynaptic receptor sensitivity rather than to a loss of presynaptic uptake inactivation."
"Native adrenocorticotropin [ACTH-(1-39)] and ACTH-(1-24) stimulate both lipolysis and magnesium accumulation in rat adipocyte plasma membrane vesicles. ACTH-(1-20) retains full lipolytic activity but has a minimal effect on magnesium accumulation. In contrast ACTH-(11-24) stimulates magnesium accumulation but not lipolysis. These findings indicate that within the ACTH molecule the peptide sequence responsible for stimulation of magnesium accumulation is distinctly separate from the core sequence (residues 4-10) essential for stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity and cAMP mediated lipolysis. Phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, blocks the bulk of magnesium accumulation stimulated by native ACTH and norepinephrine; propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, blocks the earliest phase of Mg2+ uptake by these hormones but has little effect on net uptake. Isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, stimulates magnesium uptake only minimally. The pattern of uptake stimulated by methoxamine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, or ACTH-(11-24) is quite similar to that produced by native ACTH in the presence of propranolol. The receptor through which ACTH mediates stimulation of the bulk of magnesium appears to be analogous to the alpha-adrenergic receptor through which norepinephrine stimulates this same process."
"1. The bronchial response to alpha-adrenoreceptor stimulation has been investigated in normal and asthmatic subjects with a specific alpha-receptor agonist, methoxamine hydrochloride, after atropine and beta-adrenergic blockade. 2. No significant changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1.0) were seen in normal subjects. 3. Methoxamine inhalation caused mild symptomatic wheezing and significant falls in FEV1.0 in asthmatic subjects. No change in FEV1.0 occurred after inhalation of distilled water as control. 4. It therefore appears that methoxamine causes bronchoconstriction in asthmatic subjects through its alpha-adrenergic-stimulating properties, since we were not able to detect any beta-receptor-blocking activity of methoxamine on the airways."
"Norepinephrine was given by continuous infusion at a rate of 80 microgram/kg/min for 2 min. Norepinephrine caused the appearance of cardiac arrhythmias, primarily ventricular extrasystoles. The prior administration of phentolamine, even in a dose which did not antagonize the pressor effect of norephinephrine, prevented extrasystole production by norepinephrine. Tolazoline and yohimbine, in doses which did not affect the vasopressor action of norepinephrine, also suppressed extrasystole production. It is concluded that the antiarrhythmic effect of phentolamine, does not require antagonism of alpha-adrenoceptors of the type found in the vasculature, but may involve effects on a different type of alpha-adrenoceptors in the heart."
"We studied effects on venous return of alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists in anesthetized dogs. Blood from the superior and inferior venae cavae (venous return) was drained at the level of the tricuspid valve into a reservoir, from which blood was pumped into the right atrium at a constant rate. Isoproterenol infused into the ascending aorta or the right atrium increased the venous return and heart rate and decreased systemic blood pressure. The increase in venous return produced by isoproterenol given into the right atrium was not significantly different from that produced by isoproterenol administered into the ascending aorta, although the increase in heart rate was more marked with the latter route of administration. Norepinephrine infused into the ascending aorta increased the systemic blood pressure, venous return, and heart rate. Methoxamine infused into the ascending aorta increased the systemic blood pressure and decreased the venous return but produced no change in heart rate. Isoproterenol increased the venous return even when the sinoaortic baroreceptor reflex was eliminated. Propranolol abolished the increase in venous return caused by isoproterenol and reversed the increase in venous return caused by norepinephrine. The results suggest that a decrease in venous resistance mediated through a beta-adrenergic mechanism is important in increasing venous return, whereas an increase in venous resistance mediated through an alpha-adrenergic mechanism is responsible for a decrease in venous return."
"Effects of serotonin on alpha-adrenergic receptors of isolated hamsters' atria preparation were investigated. The positive chronotropic effect of serotonin on isolated atria of the hamster is not related with postsynaptic alpha-adrenergic receptors."
"1. Adrenaline and noradrenaline have been infused into the fetal sheep to produce plasma concentrations comparable to those seen during hypoxia. The effects have been compared with those of isoprenaline and methoxamine and the sensitivity to beta- and alpha-adrenergic antagonists has been followed. 2. Adrenaline caused an alpha-mediated increase in blood glucose that is associated with a fall in plasma insulin concentration. It also caused a beta-mediated increase in plasma lactate, free fatty acid and amino acid concentrations. 3. Noradrenaline was much less effective than adrenaline at eliciting metabolic responses. It had not cause a significant change in plasma glucose concentration, although this was associated with a small increase in plasma insulin concentration. It caused a small rise in the concentration of lactate and free fatty acids in fetal plasma but had no effect on plasma amino acids. 4. The beta- and alpha-adrenergic antagonists propranolol and phentolamine alone were without effect on any of the plasma metabolites or hormones assayed. Isoprenaline increased plasma glucose, lactate, free fatty acid, alanine and insulin concentrations, while methoxamine only increased plasma glucose and lactate, and this was associated with a fall in insulin concentration. 5. The concentration of ACTH in fetal plasma was increased by adrenaline and to a lesser extent by noradrenaline and methoxamine; these were blocked by phentolamine. Isoprenaline also caused a small increase in ACTH. There were no corticosteroid changes associated with the increase in ACTH. 6. The results have been discussed in relation to the adrenergic and pancreatic control of metabolism in the fetal sheep."
"Li+ is reported to reduce sensitivity of alpha-adrenergic receptors to NE. The present investigation was designed to investigate the mechanism of this decreased sensitivity on the rat isolated seminal vesicle. In innervated preparations, 1.35 X 10(-3) M Li+ (i) shifted the concentration-response curves of NE, methoxamine, ACh and BaCl2 to the right and reduced their maximum responses; (ii) antagonized the leftward shift and the enhancement of maximum responses to NE by cocaine (2.9 X 10(-4) M), and (iii) reduced only the maximum responses to KCl. In denervated preparations, 1.35 X 10 (-3) M Li+ shifted the concentration response curve of NE to the left without any change in the maximum responses. The antagonistic effects of Li+ on maximal responses to NE, ACh and KCl observed in innervated preparations were significantly increased in Ca++-free medium. Li+ (1.35 X 10(-3) M) increased NE uptake by the seminal vesicle significantly. It is concluded that decreased sensitivity of the seminal vesicle to NE by Li+ could be due to an increase in the uptake of NE and to a nonspecific postsynaptic spasmolytic action."
"Radioactively labelled adenosine and adenine were rapidly taken up by isolated rat fat cells, and incorporated into nucleotides, of which ATP dominated. The overall process had an apparent Km of 1--5 micrometers. During incubation, especially in the presence of lipolytic agents, there was a reduction in labelled ATP with a compensatory increase in ADP, AMP, cAMP and nucleosides. The build-up of adenosine during incubation was inhibited by theophylline, which inhibits 5'-nucleotidase. Radioactivity released from perifused fat cells consisted mainly of nucleoside material, of which adenosine predominated. Lipolytic stimulation caused no significant increase in nucleoside outflow from perifused cells, whereas oxygenation was capable of reducing this outflow. It is concluded that adenosine is formed by fat cells as a consequence of ATP breakdown. Stimulation of lipolysis during activation of the sympathetic nerves leads to reversible ATP breakdown and adenosine release. Adenosine might therefore act as a modulator of lipolysis in vivo under these conditions, even though it does not serve as a feed back regulator in the proper sense."
"In incubated slices of cerebral cortex from Sprague-Dawley rats, methoxamine and clonidine have no effect on basal levels of cyclic AMP. Methoxamine effectively inhibits the noradrenaline-stimulated formation of cyclic AMP. The inhibitory constant for methoxamine was 12.6 mumol/l. In the presence of 100 mumol/l adenosine, methoxamine does not inhibit the activity of noradrenaline, but is capable to activate alpha-adrenergic receptors leading to enhanced formation of cyclic AMP. The mechanism by which adenosine alters adrenergic receptors to become methoxamine-sensitive is not known. Clonidine inhibits the effect of noradrenaline alone or in combination with adenosine on the cyclic-AMP-generating system. It does not, as reported earlier, enhance the activity of submaximal concentrations of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. These data do not support the concept of adrenergic receptors which require both, alpha- and beta-stimulation for maximal activation of adenylate cyclase."
"1. A rise or a fall in systemic blood pressure brought about by the I.V. infusion of peripherally acting drugs (adenosine, noradrenaline or methoxamine) inhibited shivering in the cold-exposed rat. 2. Since the injection of commonly used doses of noradrenaline (0.05-0.10 mumole) into a lateral cerebral ventricle of a rat was usually accompanied by a rise in blood pressure special precautious were required to determine whether noradrenaline had a specific central effect on shivering. 3. Small doses of noradrenaline (0.02-0.03 mumole) or clonidine (0.01 mumole) which had no effect on blood pressure when injected into a lateral cerebral ventricle still inhibited shivering in the cold-exposed rat and this effect was prevented by phentolamine. 4. It is concluded that noradrenaline can inhibit the cold sensor-shivering pathway in its central course by an action on alpha-receptors."
"Both isoproterenol and norepinephrine (NE) increase cyclic AMP in slices of the rat limbic forebrain and the responses are enhanced in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor RO 20-1724. However, even in the presence of RO 20-1724, no accumulation of cyclic AMP was observed after the addition of dopamine, serotonin or the alpha-agonists methoxamine and phenylephrine. This suggests that these agents do not activate adenylate cyclase in this preparation or that their respective receptors--unlike the beta-receptor--are not coupled to adenylate cyclase. Isoproterenol, which has a high affinity for this adenylate cyclase system but only 20-30\% of the maximal activity of NE, does not interfere with the agonist activity of NE. Moreover, the effect of isoproterenol is not additive with that of NE thus suggesting that isoproterenol is acting on a subpopulation of NE receptors. The results indicate that two populations of NE receptors coupled to adenylate cyclase are present in slices of rat limbic forebrain: one which has beta-characteristics and the other with neither alpha- nor beta-characteristics based on agonist studies."
"We evaluated the effects of ephedrine, mephentermine, metaraminol, phenylephrine, methoxamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline on halothane anaesthetic requirement (MAC) in dogs. MAC increased significantly only during ephedrine infusion (50\%) although significance was approached with mephentermine (21\%). Phenylephrine, metaraminol, methoxamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline did not change MAC. Arterial pressure was increased 50-100\% with all agents. Our results support the hypothesis that anaesthetic requirement may be related, in part, to release of brain noradrenaline."
"Methoxamine elicits a rapid accumulation of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in rat cerebral cortical slices with maximal effects at 100 muM. The accumulations of cyclic AMP elicited by this amine are completely blocked by the alpha adrenergic antagonists, phenoxybenzamine and dihydroergokryptine, partially blocked by the alpha antagonist, phentolamine, and unaffected by the beta blocking agent, propranolol, or by the local anesthetic, tetracaine. The magnitude of the accumulations of cyclic AMP elicited by methoxamine in cerebral cortical slices of four rat strains (F-344, ACI, BUF, and Sprague-Dawley) exhibit a strong negative correlation with spontaneous motor activity and a positive correlation with the magnitude of norepinephrine-elicited accumulations of cyclic AMP. The stimulatory interaction of methoxamine with alpha adrenergically regulated cyclic AMP-generating systems differs from the interaction of norepinephrine with alpha receptors as evidenced by the following observations: 1) the stimulatory effects of methoxamine and norepinephrine are nearly additive; 2) the stimulatory effects of methoxamine and adenosine are nearly additive, whereas the effects of norepinephrine and adenosine are much more than additive. Methoxamine, however, does not increase further the magnitude of accumulation of cyclic AMP elicited by a combination of norepinephrine and adenosine. The results are consonant with the interaction of methoxamine with alpha adrenergic receptors which are normally activated by norepinephrine only to a marginal extent. However, in the presence of adenosine, these receptors are now sensitive to activation by norepinephrine."
"To study the effects of acute uremia on the inotropic state of the rat heart, we subjected rats to bilateral nephrectomy and studied their hearts in the open chest 24 h later. Uremic rats had significantly higher systolic blood pressure than sham-operated animals. Left ventricular systolic pressure and maximum dP/dt, both during ejection and isovolumic contrations, were higher for any given end-diastolic pressure in hearts of uremic rats than in sham-operated animals. This difference in performance charcteristics was not abolished by doses of propranolol that blocked the heart rate response to isoproterenol. The administration of phenoxybenzamine during the 24 h of uremia abolished the blood pressure rise in uremic rats, but the increased contractile state persisted. Treatment of sham-operated animals with methoxamine to produce the same course of blood pressure as observed in uremic rats was also associated with an increased inotropic state. These results indicate that in the rat, acute uremia is associated with an increased inotropic state that is not mediated by beta-adrenergic mechanisms. The systolic hypertension of acute uremia is not the major cause of the increased contractility, although systolic hypertension without uremia can mimic the performance characteristics found in hearts of uremic rats."
"In cumulative dose-response studies, strips from bladder neck of rabbit were significantly more sensitive to stimulation with noradrenaline, phenylephrine, and methoxamine than were strips from detrusor. There was no difference between the two regions in sensitivity to isoprenaline or carbachol. From the known characteristics of these agents, it seemed unlikely that metabolic destruction or uptake could account for the different sensitivities seen. Also, neither normetanephrine nor desmethylimipramine could alter significantly the potency of noradrenaline in either area of the bladder. It seems likely that the difference in sensitivity to alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation in the bladder neck and detrusor is due to factors at the receptor level."
"Regional coronary blood flow was determined with the radioactive microsphere technique 10 an 70 minutes and 2 1/2 and 5 hours after abrupt occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery in 12 closed chest sedated dogs. In six dogs, nitroglycerin, 200 to 400 microng/min, was infused intravenously 10 to 70 minutes after occlusion. Methoxamine was administered to return blood pressure and heart rate to prenitroglycerin levels. Ten minutes after occlusion (before treatment) collateral flow values and ischemic zone endocardial/epicardial flow ratios were equivalent in untreated (0.11+/-0.03 ml/min per g; 0.31+/-0.05) and treated dogs (0.14+/-0.02 ml/min per g; 0.29+/-0.03). In untreated dogs, collateral flow did not change over 5 hours; the endocardial/epicardial flow ratio was decreased at 5 hours (0.21+/-0.05, P less than 0.05). In contrast, in treated dogs, collateral flow and the endocardial/epicardial flow ratio were increased at 70 minutes (0.27+/-0.04 ml/min per g, P less than 0.05; 0.53+/-0.10, P less than 0.05). Most importantly, collateral flow remained elevated 5 hours after occlusion (0.26+/-0.03 ml/min per g, P less than 0.05) although treatment was discontinued 70 minutes after occlusion. Hence, collateral flow was unchanged over 5 hours of occlusion in untreated dogs, but short-term treatment with nitroglycerin and methoxamine resulted in a sustained increase in collateral flow. These findings may be a result of stimulation by nitroglycerin and methoxamine of the spontaneous rate at which intrinsic collateral function increases after ischemia. Alternatively, nitroglycerin and methoxamine may maintain cell viability until collateral vessels develop spontaneously."
"Serotonin (5-HT), histamine, norepinephrine, methoxamine and isoproterenol caused dose-dependent contraction of human cerebral arteries. The potency of 5-HT was greater among test agents in the basilar arteries, whereas it was equivalent to that of norepinephrine in human anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries. Acetylcholine and carbachol (10(-9)-10(-5) M) caused a negligible response in human cerebral arteries. Contractile response to 5-HT was greater in the distal rather than middle portion of the human basilar arteries while this order was reversed in the response to norepinephrine. Tyramine (10(-4) M) caused tonic contraction and nicotine (10(-4) M) and electrical transmural stimulation produced phasic contraction of arteries which were antagonized by adrenergic blocking agents. Adenine nucleotides failed to cause relaxation and only high concentration of adenosine caused a minute relaxation. However, papaverine and nitroglycerin caused marked relaxation. These results suggest that adrenergic mechanism may play a role in the regulation of vascular tone in human cerebral arteries."
"The flexor reflex of acute (40-48 h after mid-thoracic spinal transection) and chronic (at least 2 months after transection) spinal rats was evoked by tetanic electrical stimulation of both hindfeet and recorded on a polygraph using a transducer connected to the left hindfoot. The flexor reflex in the chronic spinal rat was more responsive to electrical stimulation and to the actions of drugs studied than was the flexor reflex in the acute spinal rat. In chronic spinal rats, d-amphetamine, methoxamine, LSD, tryptamine, and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) facilitated the flexor reflex and induced spontaneous movements. These facilitative effects were seen in acute spinal rats only when much larger i.p. doses of amphetamine, methoxamine, and LSD were used. Small i.v. doses of tryptamine also produced the facilitation. The facilitation caused by LSD and tryptamine, but not 5-HTP, in chronic spinal rats was antagonized by cyproheptadine. These observations suggest that chronic spinal rats were more sensitive to the drugs than acute spinal rats and support the hypothesis that the mode of action of LSD is similar to that of tryptamine but different from that of 5-HTP since cyproheptadine antagonized the facilitative effects of LSD and tryptamine but not those of 5-HTP."
"Most attempts to quantitate myocardial function rely on morphologic features of complex pressure waveforms to reflect the functional properties of the ventricular myocardium. Relationships between waveform components and the function of the organ generating them were examined in 38 rhesus monkeys by harmonic analysis of left ventricular pressure waveforms. In the basal state, harmonic content was closely correlated (r=0.98) with hemodynamic state, as quantitated by heart rate, systolic and diastolic pressures, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and maximum contractile element velocity. Hemodynamic indices were expressed as significant linear functions of harmonic terms (r=0.71--0.83), in patterns consistent with the principle of superposition. In 20 animals, infusions of dextran, methoxamine, propranolol or ouabain were used to further assess this relationship. Results demonstrated (1) significant correlation between changes in hemodynamic and harmonic parameter (4= 0.99), (2) correlations between each harmonic term and the set of hemodynamic indices such that specific terms varied directly with contractility but not with loading, whereas others correlated significantly only with loading, and (3) that the patterns in these correlations were of such specificity as to permit construction of significant discriminant functions (p less than 0.0001) that accurately characterized the pharmacologically induced hemodynamic change in 85\% (56/67) of trials."
"The metabolic effects of blood flow restriction were studied in isolated blood-perfused canine subcutaneous adipose tissue. Blood flow restriction (on the average to 20 per cent of control flow) was caused by either mechanical clamping of the arterial inflow or by i.a. injections of methoxamine or angiotensin. Glucose uptake in the adipose tissue was reduced during blood flow restriction. This was partially compensated for by a period of increased glucose uptake following restoration of flow. Blood flow restriction also caused an increase in the venous lactate/pyruvate ratio. The basal lipolytic rate was decreased during blood flow restriction. Lipolysis induced by brief (5 min) sympathetic nerve stimulation (4 Hz) was not inhibited by blood flow restriction as the total amount of glycerol released from the tissue was unaffected. The outflow rate was reduced during blood flow restriction, but glycerol trapped within the tissue was apparently not reutilized by the fat cells as it was released upon flow restroation. FFA outflow following nerve stimulation was, however, inhibited suggesting increased reutilization of FFA within the tissue. This increased reutilization may ultimately be caused by the observed change in red./ox.-balance and/or by the limited carrier capacity (albumin) available during blood flow restriction. Three main conclusions may be drawn from the present results. Firstly, plasma levels of glycerol and FFA do not necessarily reflect adipose tissue lipolysis at a given moment. Secondly, the decreased adipose tissue blood flow seems to be a major cause of the lowered FFA-levels during hemorrhage. Thirdly, in contrast to hemorrhage, even severe reduction of adipose tissue blood flow is insufficient to cause irreversible ischemic damage."
"We studied the conditioning effects of chronic infusion of dobutamine and exercise training in three groups of chronically instrumented dogs. One group was infused with normal saline, a second group was infused with dobutamine (40 mug/kg per min), and the third group was exercised on a treadmill at 4 mph, up a 10 degrees incline. Each group was either infused or exercised for 2 h a day, 5 d a week for 5 consecutive wk. Resting heart rate and arterial blood lactate concentration, measured at weekly intervals, decreased progressively in the dobutamine and exercise groups, but not in the group that received normal saline infusion. Cardiovascular responses to submaximal treadmill exercise were not changed by 5 wk of normal saline infusion. However, the increases in heart rate, cardiac output, mean aortic blood pressure, arterial blood lactate, plasma renin activity, and norepinephrine concentration during exercise were significantly smaller after 5 wk of conditioning with either dobutamine or exercise training. After conditioning, the increases in arteriovenous oxygen difference during exercise were larger in the latter two groups, but the increases in total body oxygen consumption did not differ before and after conditioning. To assess ventricular function, we intravenously infused methoxamine both before and after conditioning. The slope of the line that related systolic aortic blood pressure and mean left atrial pressure increased in the animals conditioned with either dobutamine or exercise, indicating enhanced myocardial contractility. Left ventricular blood flow was lower in these two groups of animals than it was in the normal saline group. Left ventricular weight did not differ among the three groups. Our results show that chronic infusion of dobutamine produced cardiovascular and metabolic conditioning effects like those produced by exercise training, and further suggest that sympathetic stimulation during exercise plays a role in physical conditioning."
"Uterine mucus secretion was studied by measuring carbohydrate release from everted guinea-pig uteri placed in organ baths. Field stimulation of the organ resulted in a significant increase in carbohydrate out-put, this increase was inhibited by tetrodotoxin, scopolamine and previous destruction of the paracervical ganglia. Previous section of the hypogastric nerve reduced the response to field stimulation, while interruption of the costouterine connexion or the pelvic nerve was without overt effect. Stimulation of the hypogastric nerve increased uterine carbohydrate secretion. Pelvic nerve stimulation produced no significant effect. Carbachol increased the carbohydrate secretion to the same extent as did field stimulation. Isoprenaline and methoxamine were without significant effect. It is suggested that certain endometrial cells have a cholinergic sympathetic secretory innervation with pre- and postganglionic fibers running in the hypogastric nerve."
"To determine whether the rate of fatty acid utilization, reflecting myocardial oxygen consumption under steady-state conditions, can be assessed noninvasively, we assayed positron emission from [11C]palmitate (100 muCi) in isolated rabbit hearts and after intra-atrial injection in vivo. In 11 isolated hearts, clearance of 11C-radioactivity during a monoexponential portion of residue detection curves correlated with tension-time index (TTI)(r = 0.86) and peak dP/dt (r = 0.89). Among 9 hearts prelabeled with [14C]palmitate, 14CO2 production from neutral lipid stores correlated with TTI (r = 0.83). In vivo the decline of 11C-radioactivity was 1st order and constant when physiological conditions were maintained constant (slope of the semilog plot = 0.099 +/- 0.002 (SE) in counts/min) (n = 2 animals, 7 injections). Decline of activity changed predictably when oxygen requirements were increased by administration of methoxamine. Thus, residue detection of [11C]palmitate 1) permits external assessment of global myocardial metabolism in vitro, and 2) reflects effects of interventions that alter the rate of substrate utilization in vivo, and should, therefore, permit comparison of rates of regional myocardial metabolism in patients with detection of radioactivity by positron-emission transaxial tomography."
"Maximal changes in haemodynamics and segmental wall motion were seen 2 min after coronary occlusion and were examined in relation to the loading conditions of the left ventricle before occlusion in 20 open chest dogs. There was a significant inverse relationship between the preligation mean aortic pressure and the percentage decrease in stroke volume following ligation. This relationship was observed whether afterload was distributed randomly (mean aortic pressure ranging from 9.7 to 17.6 kPa [73 to 132 mmHg]) between all dogs (r = 0.65; P less than 0.001) or altered by methoxamine (+4 kPa [+30 mmHg]) and nitroprusside (-3.2 kPa [-24 mmHg]) within the same dog (r = 0.82; P less than 0.001; n = 8). Although occlusion of the anterior descending artery caused a small (+5.5\%) but significant increase in end-diastolic length of the non-ischaemic epicardial segment, the capacity for compensatory ventricular dilatation was not dependent on preligation afterload. However, the capacity of the ischaemic segment to undergo systolic expansion was significantly greater (+30.2\% of end-systolic segment length) in those dogs with the lowest preligation MAP (8 to 12 kPa [60 to 90 mmHg]) compared with systolic lengthening of only 15.8\% in the high afterload group (15 to 18 kPa [112 to 135 mmHg]). These data indicate that the loading conditions of the left ventricle predetermine the extent of global and segmental left ventricular dysfunction during the early phase of acute ischaemic injury."
"The effects of vasoconstrictors and vasodilators were compared in conscious, newborn lambs and adult sheep instrumented with electromagnetic flow probes on the ascending aorta and catheters in the thoracic aorta. Methoxamine, angiotensin II, norepinephrine, nitroglycerin and isoproterenol were administered intravenously to evaluate their effects on arterial pressure, cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). The difference in response between adults and newborns was most apparent with methoxamine. Methoxamine, 400 micrograms/kg, i.v., which increased mean arterial pressure by 57 +/- 6\% and SVR by 278 +/- 27\% in newborn lambs, caused greater increases (p less than 0.01) of 81 +/- 8\% and 1418 +/- 141\%, respectively, in the adults. Responses also differed significantly between newborn and adult animals to norepinephrine, angiotensin II, nitroglycerin and isoproterenol. In a second group of animals in which smaller amounts of methoxamine and isoproterenol were injected directly into the terminal aorta, changes in terminal aortic flow and resistance were examined. Again, both vasoconstrictor and vasodilator responses were more marked in adults than in newborns. Finally, the sensitivity of the arterial baroreceptor reflex was evaluated by comparing the regression of pulse interval (PI) on systolic arterial pressure (SAP) after an intravenous dose of methoxamine in conscious, adult and newborn animals. The PI/SAP slopes in adult sheep, 45.4 +/- 3.5 msec/mm Hg, were significantly greater (p less than 0.01) than in newborn lambs, 11.7 +/- 2.2 msec/mm Hg."
"Local application of collars containing 25\% methoxamine, 50\% or 75\% tyramine or 50\% norephedrine to both vasa deferentia of rats caused a reduction in fertility but not in their ability to mate. A gradual return to fertility was seen in those animals which received the lower dose of tyramine or norephedrine, while the other treatments caused a permanent reduction in fertility. The cause of sterility was production of azoospermic ejaculates resulting from either a block in sperm transport in the vas deferens or from a deficiency in the ejaculatory mechanism. Only methoxamine caused a mechanical obstruction of the vas deferens, but it is possible that the other drugs caused a sustained spasm. An emission defect could have been due to transmitter depletion, receptor-specific desensitization or presynaptic alpha-adrenoreceptor-mediated inhibition. Spermatozoa from the cauda epididymidis were immotile following the treatments."
"The sympathomimetic drugs noradrenaline, methoxamine, tyramine and norephedrine caused rhythmic contractions in isolated human vasa deferentia. Provided the drug was not washed out, these contractions lasted for the entire duration of the experiment (4-6 h). These contractions were mediated via alpha-adrenoreceptors. Intravenous administration of methoxamine or oxymetazolene to rats or guinea-pigs produced contractions of the vas deferens in vivo in some experiments but was accompanied by severe cardiovascular side effects. A local method of application was developed, using mixtures of tyramine with Silastic prepared as collars specially designed to fit round the vas deferens. Acute and chronic insertion of these slow-releasing devices around the vas deferens of rats produced rhythmic contractions of the vas deferens without any serious side effects."
"The effect of estrogen and progesterone on the reactivity of isolated rabbit saphenous veins to adrenergic stimulation by norepinephrine, methoxamine, phenylephrine, and electrical stimulation and the effect of progesterone on the reactivity to barium ions were studied. 8 days after ovariectomy, a saphenous vein was removed and studied in vitro. After 1 and 4 days of hormone therapy, the contralateral vein was removed and its reactivity was compared with that of the first vein and with that of veins from untreated, sham-operated control animals. The reactivity to adrenergic and noradrenergic stimulation was increased after 4 days of treatment with progesterone (5 mg/day); treatment for 4 days with estrogen (100 micrograms/day) increased the reactivity to norepinephrine, electrical stimulation, methoxamine, and phenylephrine. The results with progesterone suggest that the increased adrenergic responsiveness is not related to a mechanism controlling adrenergic transmission in veins."
"Sensitivity to norepinephrine (expressed as pD2) was different between the prostatic and the epididymal half of the rat vas deferens. The epididymal half was more sensitive than the prostatic half; difference in pD2 was 0.826 +/- 0.095 (mean +/- S.E., 13 experiments). Between the two halves, nearly the same difference in pD2, 0.745 +/- 0.125 (6 experiments), was observed in the responses to methoxamine, which is not incorporated into the adrenergic nerve terminals. In the two halves, 3 x 10(-6) M phentolamine produced a smiliar decrease in pD2 of norepinephrine: 1.485 +/- 0.056 and 1.282 +/- 0.080 in the prostatic and epididymal half, respectively (6 experiments). Only in the prostatic half, 10(-5) M propranolol produced a slight increase in pD2 of norepinephrine, 0.344 +/- 0.133 (6 experiments). Sensitivity to K+ was also different between the two halves. These results suggest that the difference in the sensitivity to norepinephrine between the prostatic and the epididymal half is due to postjunctional natures varying along the length of the rat vas deferens."
"Pimozide (5--10 ng/ml), haloperidol (0.5--5 ng/ml) and yohimbine (2--5 ng/ml) selectively potentiated dopamine-induced and methoxamine-induced contractions of the rat vas deferens. The concentration-response curves were significantly shifted to the left and the maximal responses were significantly increased. Responses of the vas deferens to noradrenaline were not so influenced. Concentrations of the antagonists in excess of 50 ng/ml produced concentrations-related parallel shifts of dopamine concentration-response curve to the right. These antagonists behaved in a similar manner towards methoxamine, a directly acting sympathomimetic amine which has a low affinity for neuronal uptake, suggesting that the mechanism of this potentiation may be independent of neuronal uptake inhibition."
"If nasal mucosa is removed from the dog's septum, mounted in a muscle bath and treated with a small dose of a nasal decongestant, the mucosa contracts, It appears, from the nature of the tissue and the nature of the drug responses, that nasal vascular smooth muscle is the contracting element. If the nasal mucosa is treated with a vasodilating agent, such as histamine, there is no relaxation response unless the mucosa is first pretreated with a vasoconstricting agent such as epinephrine. Both vasoconstricting and vasodilating drugs induce dose-related responses. It appears that this new preparation may be useful to assay drug effects in the absence of nervous and humoral control."
"Previous studies have shown that dicyclohexylamine (DCHA) and related amines with saturated and unsaturated cyclic side-chains produce a potentiation of noradrenaline responses in rat vas deferens. The present study shows that the potentiation is mediated via a cocaine-like effect, by acting as neuronal uptake inhibitors on sympathetic nerve terminals of the rat vas deferens. Furthermore, it has been established that the contractions of the vas, which are induced by high concentrations of DCHA and its analogues, are due to an indirect sympathomimetic activity of these compounds."
"To investigate the effect of different anesthetics on the flow properties of the central circulation, curves were obtained by the multiple indocyanine-green indicator-dilution technic from 7 dogs anesthetized with halothane or pentobarbital. The width of the curve provided a measure of the dispersion of indicator particles during passage through the central circulation. The vascular resistance of the animals was altered by the administration of methoxamine and sodium nitroprusside. The authors found that dispersion in the central circulation is linearly related to the total peripheral resistance (TPR). For any value of TPR, the amount of dispersion of indicator particles passing through the central circulation was greater with halothane plus pentobarbital anesthesia than with pentobarbital only. The study indicates that the type of anesthesia influences the dispersion of indicator particles passing through the central circulation. A better under standing of this process will be helpful in interpreting the results of indicator-dilution cardiac-output determinations performed in persons under general anesthesia."
"Four subjects with orthostatic hypotension were given intravenous infusions of methoxamine and isoproterenol. Methoxamine caused an elevation in systolic blood pressure. Isoproterenol resulted in a fall in blood pressure in three of the subjects. The heart rate decreased with methoxamine, but increased with isoproterenol. The responsivity in orthostatic hypotension was compatible with denervation supersensitivity. These effects were compared with the responsivity to methoxamine and isoproterenol of five labile hypertensives. Two patients with severe orthostatic hypotension were treated with regimens including levodopa. Levodopa alone would further aggravate postural hypotension. But in one subject given levodopa, ephedrine, and fludrocortisone and in the other managed on levodopa, tranylcypromine, and fludrocortisone, symptomatic orthostatic hypotension was successfully eliminated. These results support the usefulness of levodopa, in combination with adrenergic agents, as a therapeutic measure for advanced forms of orthostatic hypotension."
"Twenty patients with fixed coronary artery obstruction were studied during rapid atrial pacing and methoxamine infusion. During pacing to heart rates of 142 +/- 4 (mean +/- SEM) beats per minute coronary sinus flow increased from 108 +/- 8 to 187 +/- 15 cc/min and myocardial oxygen consumption increased by + 80 +/- 11\%. During methoxamine infusion that raised arterial systolic pressure to 196 +/- 5 mm Hg, similar increases in coronary sinus flow (to 179 +/- 13 cc/min) and myocardial oxygen consumption (+ 77 +/- 12\%) occurred. Chest pain and ischemic ST segment changes developed in 17 and 14 patients respectively during atrial pacing, an incidence significantly greater (P less than 0.05) than during infusion of methoxamine (6 and 3 patients). Myocardial lactate extraction which averaged 26 +/- 4\% during control was decreased to 10 +/- 8\% during pacing and to 24 +/- 7\% during methoxamine; the difference between decreases was not significant. The data show that at similar increases in myocardial oxygen consumption stress of increased heart rate results in more myocardial ischemia than stress of increased afterload."
"Cardiovascular effects of methoxamine and some aminotetralin derivatives (5,8-ADT, DR-31 and DR-17) were studied after systemic intravenous or intraarterial injection into different perfused vascular beds in anesthetized dogs. Intravenous administration of the compounds produced dose-related prolonged increases in blood pressure, which were antagonized by phentolamine. After intro-arterial injection into the perfused hindlimb, mesenteric artery or the saphenous vein, all compounds produced dose-dependent increases in perfusion pressure indicative of vasoconstriction. Phentolamine antagonized these effects. It was demonstrated that desipramine significantly reduced the vasoconstricting actions of intra-arterially injected tyramine in the hindlimb, but did not alter the responses induced by methoxamine and the aminotetralin derivatives. The data indicate that these compounds elicit peripheral vasoconstriction in the dog, through a direct action on the alpha adrenergic receptors."
"Plasmatic arterionecrosis, the causative lesion of hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage, follows upon medial muscle cell necrosis. The development of medial muscle cell necrosis, the earliest cerebral arterial change seen in hypertensive rats, was inhibited when these animals were fed a cholesterol and lard-supplemented diet. Insudation of fibrin was noted in the arterial intima of hypertensive rats with bilaterally constricted renal arteries. Removal of the constriction induced a fall in the elevated blood pressure and an increase of intimal muscle cells. These were responsible for the dissolution of the deposited fibrin, leading to arteriosclerosis. These myointimal cells may originate from the endothelium. Arterial contraction caused by methoxamine hydrochloride often induced the intrusion of one medial muscle cell into another and increased endothelial permeability. 12-24 h after contraction, the arterial segments showed medial muscle cell necrosis, endothelial desquamation with platelet adhesion, and blood plasma infiltration."
"6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) increased the sensitivity of rat, rabbit and guinea pig portal veins to norepinephrine (NE), methoxamine (ME), barium (Ba++) and calcium (Ca++) but not to potassium (K+). Reserpine potentiated the responses of NE, ME and Ca++ but not Ba++ or K+ in rabbit and guinea pig veins and did not alter the sensitivity of rat veins to all agonists tested. Cocaine only potentiated the NE responses of the veins and decreased the sensitivity of rabbit and guinea pig veins to K+. 6-OHDA increased 48Ca-influx in all veins whereas reserpine increased 45Ca-influx only in rabbit and guinea pig veins. Cocaine failed to increase 45Ca-influx in all veins tested. NE, ME and K+ increased 45Ca-influx in the veins from the different animals. The agonist-induced 45Ca-influx was greater in most of the supersensitive veins than in the control veins. In veins that failed to develop supersensitivity, agonist-induced 45Ca-influx did not differ from that of the control veins. It is concluded that the development of super- and subsensitivity exhibits species variation and that the alteration in Ca++ influx would be consistent with the changes in sensitivity of the venous smooth muscle."
"After cold storage treatment (5-7 days at 2 degrees C) the sensitivity to norepinephrine (NE) was increased in rabbit portal vein, decreased in rat portal vein and not altered in guinea pig portal vein. Cold storage decreased the sensitivity to methoxamine (ME), Ba++ and Ca++ in rat and guinea pig veins but not in rabbit veins and failed to alter the sensitivity to K+ in all veins tested. Cold storage increased 45Ca-influx while it reduced the NE content and 3H-NE uptake of all portal veins examined. NE and ME-induced 45Ca-influx was greater in cold-stored veins that in fresh veins from rabbit and guinea pig. K+ decreased 45Ca-influx in all cold-stored veins. These results indicate that cold storage induces a prejunctional supersensitivity in rabbit portal vein but not in guinea pig and rat portal veins. However, cold storage increased 45Ca-influx in all three veins."
"The release of prostaglandin E elicited by sympathomimetic amines was studied in the isolated rabbit heart. The hearts were prepared according to Langendorff, with conventional recording of stroke frequency and contractile force. Assays were made of the outflow of PGE during exposition to equimolar concentrations of methoxamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline and isoprenaline, in the absence and in the presence of phentolamine or propranolol. Noradrenaline caused an almost four-fold increase in the basal outflow of PGE from the heart, while methoxamine (an alpha-adrenoceptor agonist) and isoprenaline (a beta-adrenoceptor agonist) were both ineffective in this respect. Thus, the PGE-releasing capacity of the drugs was not correlated to their ability to activate alpha- or or beta-adrenoceptors. Furthermore, no relation was obtained between the PGE release induced by the drugs and the increase in heart rate and contractile force elicited by them. It is suggested that sympathomimetic drugs trigger PGE synthesis and release in the rabbit myocardium following activation of a hitherto unobserved adrenoceptive mechanism, optimally stimulated by NA."
"Coronary blood flow was measured using labelled microspheres (15 micrometer diameter) in sedentary and endurance trained rats during hypoxaemic conditions designed to develop coronary dilatation (Pa,O2 6.0 to 6.7 kPa [45 to 60 mmHg]). Rats that were trained for 12 to 18 weeks (26.8 m per minute, 15\% gradient, 1 hour per day) had a significantly greater coronary blood flow conductance (15.3 +/- 1.0 mm3.min-1.kPa-1 aortic diastolic pressure, n = 20) than sedentary animals (10.8 +/- 0.9, n = 19). Even though cardiac hypertrophy (17\%) was found in the trained animals, this increase in perfused mass accounted for only one-third of the increase in total coronary blood flow. Thus, there was a greater coronary blood flow per unit mass of the myocardium in the trained rats."
"With a radionuclide technique, left ventricular ejection fraction and stroke volume index were measured in the basal state and after the stress of a methoxamine-induced increase in afterload in 10 men with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The resting mean left ventricular ejection fraction was normal in all 10 patients. After an acute increase in resistance to left ventricular ejection with methoxamine, the left ventricular ejection fraction and the stroke volume index did not decrease significantly, even in the presence of cor pulmonale in 5 patients. Mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was normal before, and did not change significantly after, methoxamine infusion. The data suggest that latent left ventricular dysfunction is not present in this group of patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."
"The apexcardiogram, kinetocardiogram and carotid pulse tracing were studied in 24 normal subjects and 20 patients with aortic insufficiency. The electrocardiogram and phonocardiogram were recorded simultaneously as the time reference. The study of the carotid pulse tracing and systolic time intervals was made using the injection of methoxane and inhalation of amyl nitrite. In aortic insufficiency, the apexcardiogram of the infinite decay time tended to demonstrate a lift of end-systolic shoulder according to the severity of the disease, while, kinetocardiograms at K-45 showed a prominent systolic outward movement. The correlation ratio of these findings between normal and aortic insufficiency was 0.59 in the apexcardiogram and 0.72 in the kinetocardiogram. The findings were also correlated with CTR with a correlation coefficient of 0.41 and 0.62 in aortic insufficiency only or 0.63 and 0.81 including normal cases. The apexcardiogram of the short time constant represented no characteristic changes. Therefore, it might be concluded that the kinetocardiogram is more useful than the apexcardiogram in determining the existence and severity of aortic insufficiency. Effects of acute hemodynamics changes: the effects of increasing total peripheral resistance on the externally recorded carotid pulse were determined by the injection of methoxamine. This drug showed changes characterized by a rise in the ratio of the height of the tidal wave to that of the percussion wave. In contrast, amyl nitrite decreased total peripheral resistance and produced a significant decline in the ratio of the height of the tidal wave to that of the percussion wave. In conclusions, the carotid waves contain two systolic maximums, the percussion wave and tidal wave, the former related, at least in part, to peak blood volume and the latter to aortic pressure. Comparing with systolic time intervals in aortic insufficiency and that of normal cases, the patients with aortic insufficiency had statistically significant increase in the ejection time index and pre-ejection time, especially after the injection of methoxamine."
"In 14 dogs the determinants of myocardial blood supply and metabolic demands were assessed during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and under steady-state conditions in fibrillating hearts on cardiopulmonary bypass. During open chest cardiac massage (nine dogs), coronary diastolic blood pressure and blood flow were low. Vasopressor infusion (methoxamine or epinephrine) raised diastolic pressure from 33 +/- 3 to 55 +/- 3 mm. Hg and increased coronary blood flow (CBF) 124 percent (from 38 +/- 3 to 85 +/- 11 c.c. per 100 Gm. per minute. Comparison of these drugs in fibrillating hearts on cardiopulmonary bypass showed that epinephrine increased the "vigor of fibrillation" (intraventricular balloon pressure rose 24 percent and oxygen uptake increased 42\%) but impeded subendocardial flow 53\% (endocardial/epicardial flow ratio fell from 0.79 to 0.48). In contrast, methoxamine did not significantly change intraventricular balloon pressure, oxygen uptake, coronary flow, or its distribution. We conclude that augmentation of diastolic pressure with alpha adrenergic drugs during CPR improves coronary perfusion and that inotropic drugs may worsen myocardial ischemia during CPR by raising oxygen demands while simultaneously impeding subendocardial blood supply."
"The effects of phentolamine (10(-6)M) and prazosin (10(-7)M) on contractile responses, in the presence of cocaine or nortriptyline, were investigated in vas deferens and anococcygeus muscle of rat. Cocaine (10(-5)M) and nortriptyline (10(-6)M) had no effect on maximum responses to field stimulation, (--)-noradrenaline, methoxamine, and acetylcholine in anococcygeus muscle. However, both cocaine (3.3 x 10(-5)M) and nortripthline (10(-6)M) potentiated maximum responses to (--)-noradrenaline without altering the maximum response to field stimulation in vas deferens. In vas deferens, phentolamine potentiated or inhibited the responses to field stimulation depending on the frequency whereas prazosin inhibited all responses to field stimulation. In anococcygeus muscle, both phentolamine and prazosin inhibited all responses to field stimulation. In vas deferens and anococcygeus muscle, prazosin was a more potent antagonist of responses to (--)-noradrenaline than phentolamine. These results show that prazosin is a more potent postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist than phentolamine and suggest that prazosin has little or no affinity for presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors."
"Previous work has suggested partial depolarization of the smooth muscles cells to be an important factor in the post junctional supersensitivity induced in the guinea-pig vator in the post junctional supersensitivity induced in the guinea-pig vas deferens by chronic denervation or decentralization. The present experiments were undertaken to explore, under acute in vitro conditions, the relationship between membrane potential changes and sensitivity in the vasa deferentia of guinea pigs and rats. The results indicate that sensitivity was altered whenever resting potential was changed by 7 to 10 mV. The results also indicated that considerable electrophysiologic differences exist between the smooth muscles of the guinea-pig and rat vas deferens. Notably, ouabain or lowered external potassium caused a partial depolarization of the guinea-pig, but not the rat, vas deferens. The results, especially when combined with evidence that the rat vas deferens does possess a considerable amount of (Na+-K+)-adenosine triphosphatase, which is ouabain-sensitive, indicates that under the conditions of these experiments the Na pump is electrogenic in the guinea-pig, but not the rat, vas deferens."
"1. Adrenaline and noradrenaline have been infused into the fetal sheep to produce plasma concentrations comparable to those seen during hypoxia and the cardiovascular changes compared with those seen in response to hypoxia. The effect of isoprenaline, methoxamine, and beta- and alpha-adrenergic antagonists were also investigated. 2. There were no significant changes in the blood gas values during any of the infusions except for a mean fall in pH of 0.04 during adrenaline infusion. 3. Adrenaline caused a fall in the fetal heart rate followed by a rise above the control value after 15-20 min. The fall in heart rate was abolished when the rise in blood pressure was blocked with phentolamine. The rise in heart rate was blocked by propranolol. The exact cause of the biphasic changes in heart rate during adrenaline infusion is not clear. 4. A fall in heart rate was not seen with noradrenaline; a small rise was. Propranolol changed this into a fall in heart rate while phentolamine increased the size of the heart rate rise. 5. Phentolamine alone increased the fetal heart rate by 25\% and reduced blood pressure by 12\%; propranolol alone reduced heart rate by 14\% and had no effect on blood pressure. Isoprenaline increased fetal heart rate and reduced blood pressure. 6. The incidence of fetal breathing movements was highly variable. Despite this a significant increase was observed during adrenaline infusion. None of the other infusions had consistent effects. 7. The role of the circulating catecholamines in mediating or modifying the cardiovascular responses to hypoxia in the fetal sheep is discussed."
"The effect of acutely induced hypertension on aortic valve competence was studied in anesthetized dogs. Aortic pressure was increased by infusion of methoxamine or mechanically; aortic valve competence was evaluated by aortogrphy and by indicator dye. The aortic valve was normally competent; aortic insufficiency appeared with increase of mean pressure by as little as 20-50 mmHg; 6 of 9 animals showed aortic incompetence when mean aortic pressure was elevated  45-70 mmHg, but the valve remained competent in 2 of 9 animals with mean pressure increments of 60-90 mmHg. The aortic root was appreciably less distensible than was the proximal descending aorta; this factor may limit the degree of aortic insufficiency in response to acute hypertension in the dog."
"A number of hemodynamic, pharmacologic, and metabolic interventions were found to change the extent of acute ischemic injury of the myocardium and subsequent necrosis following  experimental coronary artery occlusion. Reduction in myocardial damage occurred by decreasing myocardial oxygen demands (beta-adrenergic blocking agents, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, nitroglycerin, decreasing afterload in hypertensive patients, inhibition of lipolysis, and digitalis in the failing heart); by increasing myocardial oxygen supply either directly (coronary artery reperfusion or elevating arterial pO2), or through collateral vessels (evevation of coronary perfusion pressure by alpha adrenergic agonists, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation); or by increasing plasma osmolality (manitol, hypertonic glucose); presumably by augmenting anaerobi metabolism (glucose-insulin-potassium, hypertonic glucoxe insulin potassium, hypertonic glucose); by enhancing transport to the ischemic zone of substrates utilized in energy production (hyaluronidase); by protecting against autolytic and heterolytic damage (hydrocortisone, cobra venom factor, aprotinin). Augmentation of myocardial ischemic damage occurred as a consequence of increasing myocardial oxygen requirements (isoproterenol, glucagon, ouabain, bretylium tosylate, tachycardia); by decreasing myocardial oxygen supply either directly (hypoxia, anemia), through reduction of collateral flow (hemorrhagic hypotension, minoxidil), or by decreasing substrate availability (hypoglycemia). Pilot studies have been carried out in patients with hyaluronidase, nitroglycerin intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, beta-blocking agents and Arfonad and have shown that these interventions may also reduce myocardial damage, which suggests that the concept of reduction in infarct size following coronary occlusion is applicable clinically."
"Vasoactive agents may have vasoconstrictor, vasodilator, cardiac stimulatory, or combined effects on the cardiovascular system. The intensity or degree of therapeutic effect differs with each agent. Table 1 provides a relative ranking of each discussed compound's effect regarding its ability to produce one or more of the listed effects. The effects of vasoconstrictor drugs such as methoxamine, phenylephrine, and norepinephrine have been generally unfavorable in shock because of the inhibition of tissue perfusion which results from their use. Debate still exists, however, and these agents have been shown to provide some benefit in selected cases. The rationale that shock results at least in part because of intense vasoconstriction has led to the usage of vasodilators in therapy. Currently isoproterenol, a beta adrenergic stimulating agent, is being used to elicit vasodilation in lieu of alpha blockage because the alpha blocking drugs phenoxybenzamine and chlorpromazine have longer, more irreversible effects. The merit of isoproterenol has to be evaluated in light light of its cardiac stimulatory effect. With the current antishock drugs, those which possess cardiac stimulatory effects seem to be most effective with the exception of those with alpha stimulatory properties. The importance of cardiac stimulation in treating shock is related to the fact that in many forms of shock a decrease in cardiac function is evident. Drugs which effect increases in cardiac performance will increase cardiac output and tissue perfusion. The increased excitability of the heart caused by many of the drugs is a drawback, but compounds such as dopamine seem to have less excitatory effect than does isoproterenol. It may be that vasoconstriction, vasodilation, and cardiac stimulation are all contributory to the alleviation of shock. However, it is important to remember that the use of vasoactive agents must be reserved for those deteriorating shock states in which primary and secondary factors responsible for the initial state have been adequately controlled and only when appropriate methods for judging hemodynamic performance have been instituted."
"Nitroglycerin (TNG) reduces ischemic injury during acute coronary occlusion in dogs with otherwise normal coronary arteries, but its effect in the presence of pre-existing multivessel coronary disease is unknown.  We therefore examined the influence of TNG on acute ischemia in dogs with chronic multivessel coronary occlusions.  The left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery was acutely occluded by a balloon cuff in conscious dogs two weeks after placement of ameroid constrictors to produce gradual occlusion of the obtuse marginal and posterior descending coronary arteries.  Adequacy of balloon and ameroid coronary occlusion and degree of collateralization were assessed by coronary angiography.  Nitroglycerin decreased arterial pressure and increased heart rate.  Myocardial ischemia, determined after LAD occlusion by summing ST-segment elevation (sigmaST) from eight intramyocardial electrodes, lessened with TNG in those six dogs whose heart rate increased less than 50 per cent, but increased in those four whose heart rate increased greater than 50 per cent.  When TNG-induced change in either heart rate or arterial pressure was prevented by adding methoxamine, sigma ST was diminished even more (avg decrease 25 per cent; P smaller than 0.05).  We conclude that, in the presence of pre-existing multivessel coronary occlusions, 1) TNG reduces ischemic injury during experimental acute coronary occlusion provided arterial pressure and heart rate responses are not excessive and 2) uniform improvement occurs when pressure and rate responses are abolished by an alpha-adrenergic agonist.  Although results in animal studies must be extrapolated to the clinical situation with caution, these findings suggest that a similar pharmacologic approach might be applicable to the treatment of acute myocardial infarction in man, even in the presence of multivessel disease."
"A noninvasive method to determine systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure values in rhesus monkeys is described and evaluated. Simultaneous measurements of abdonimal aortic and tail-cuff pressures were compared for unanesthetized, anesthetized, hemorrhaged, and methoxamine-treated animals. Data indicated that correlation between direct and indirect methods were highly significant (r greater than or equal to 0.94); the mean differences found between the two measurements were less than or equal to 8 mm. Hg, with the exception of the methoxamine-treated groups. Reliability of the technique was considerably reduced following administration of this drug."
"Nitroglycerin (NTG) traditionally has bben avoided in the treatment of pain caused by acute myocardial infarction because of the belief that NTG-induced decrease in arterial pressure and concomitant reflex increase in heart rate might extend the ischemic process. However, recent experimental and clinical investigations cast doubt on this concept. For example, when the left anterior descending coronary artery is acutely occluded in normal dogs or in dogs when chronic coronary occlusions and extensive collaterals, NTG reduces ST-segment  evevation (and presumably myocardial ischemia). This salutary effect occurs despite lowering of systemic arterial pressure, as long as excessive reflex tachycardia does not result; the magnitude of ischemia reduction is potentiated when methoxamine or phenylephrine are administered simultaneously to abolish the NTG -induced hypotension and reflex tachycardia. NTG and methoxamine treatment also results in 1) reduction of infarct size as (as assessed by gross morphologic examinations and myocardial CPK levels) in dogs subjected to 5 hours of coronary occlusion, and 2) increase in ventricular fibrillation (VF) threshold and reduction of the incidence of spontaneously occurring VF in dogs with acute coronary occlusion. Finally, the effectiveness of NTG during acute myocardial iinfarction (AMI) in man has been studied. Multiple precordial electrodes were used to measure changes in the degree of ST-segment elevation; these changes were used as an index of alterations in myocardial ischemic injury. Patients with normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressures ( less than 15 mm Hg) did not benefit consistently from NTG alone; however, when phenylephrine was administered with NTG (to abolish NTG-induced arterial pressure reduction and reflex increase in heart rate), ST-segment elevation diminished consistently. In patients with elevated wedge pressures ( greater than 15 mm Hg), NTG alone consistently reduced ischemia; addition of phenylephrine often partially reversed this benefit. Thus, administration of NTG, alone or with phenylephrine, appears to reduce myocardial ischemic injury during AMI in man; however, the response to phenylephrine depends upon the presence or absence of LV failure prior to treatment. These experimental and clinical results suggest this form of therapy may be use in reducing infarct size in man, although additional studies are necessary to determine the functional significance of these acute electrophysiologic alterations."
"In an attempt to improve the quality of information provided by measuring the systolic times, the effect of three thpes of sensitising test was studied: the test with venous tourniquets on the lower limbs, the test with methoxamine, and the test under isometric exercise. In none of these tests was there found to be a statistically significant difference between the controls and the patients with myocardial infarction, with or without left ventricular failure. Taken as a whole, however, the sensitising tests studied tended to accentuate the abnormalities in the systolic times established under basal conditions in patients with myocardial infarction more grossly than in controls."
"To elucidate the role of arterial baroreceptors in the acute regulation of arterial pressure in the conscious animal, arterial pressure was lowered and raised in intact, conscious dogs, and in dogs after bilateral section of both carotid sinus and aortic nerves (total arterial baroreceptor denervation, TABD). Pressure was altered by intravenous bolus injections and continuous infusions of nitroglycerin and methoxamine and also by hemorrhage. TABD resulted in a change in peak mean arterial pressure 2-4 times as great as that seen in intact dogs following injection of nitroglycerin or methoxamine. However, when the time taken for the arterial pressure disturbance to return to control levels, as well as the absolute change in arterial pressure, was considered (the pressure-time product), responses of dogs with TABD were far greater for nitroglycerin (7-9 times that seen in intact dogs) and methoxamine (11-15 times). Arterial pressure responses of dogs with selective section of the carotid sinus nerves were intermediate but closer to those of intact dogs than to dogs with TABD. With infusion of drugs or following hemorrhage, responses of mean arterial pressure were 3- to 5-fold greater in dogs with TABD than in intact dogs, indicating that the static open loop gain of the arterial baroreceptor system ranged from 2 to 4."
"Coronary vasodilators have been variously reported to increase, decrease, or have no effect upon blood flow to ischemic myocardium. Consequently, the effects of two different types of dilators, nitroglycerin (TNG) and dipyridamole, were studied with radioactive microspheres in open-chested dogs after coronary artery ligation. Given as a bolus i.v. injection 0.4 mg TNG resulted in an increase in blood flow to nonischemic areas of myocardium and a preservation of flow to ischemic regions, despite a fall in blood pressure. 5 min later blood pressure and nonischemic flow were back to base line, and a small selective increase in flow to ischemic myocardium was found (0.15-0.18 ml/min per g, P less than 0.05). During an 0.2 mg/min infusion of TNG, and also after 1 mg/kg i.v. dipyridamole, ischemic flow was maintained in the face of a 20-30\% reduction in blood pressure. In this setting, nonischemic flow was unchanged during TNG and doubled after dipyridamole. With the addition of methoxamine in both dilator groups, blood pressure returned to base line while flow to ischemic areas increased above base-line values (TNG, 0.16-0.20 ml/min per g, P less than 0.01; dipyridamole, 0.18-0.31 ml/min per g, P less than 0.05). Epicardial ST segment elevations increased during TNG infusion and were unchanged after dipyridamole, but with addition of methoxamine, ST segments became less elevated in both drug groups, concomitant with the observed increase in collateral blood flow. These data indicate that both types of coronary vasodilators, when used in conjunction with methoxamine to support blood pressure, reduce collateral resistance, increase collateral flow, and reduce epicardial ST-segment elevations."
"Relationship has been established between epicardial ST-segment elevation, considered a reliable estimate of ischemic injury in experimental myocardial damage, and ST changes by multiple-lead precordial electrocardiography. However, 35-lead precordial mapping is time-consuming and suitable only for anterior infarctions. An alternate, more rapid method for recording ST segments is an external 3-lead orthogonal vectorcardiographic (VCG) system which also can assess the entire ventricle. Accordingly, validity of VCG ST magnitude was evaluated by direct comparison with changes in epicardial ST magnitude (EST) induced by occlusion of major coronary arteries, reperfusion, and pharmacologic interventions in 15 closed-chest dogs. A total of 404 data points (average 27/dog), 20 epicardial grid and 3 Frank XYZ leds each, demonstrated close correlation (least squares linear regression) between VCG ST and EST changes (r = 0.921 +/- 0.02 SEM). These data document the accuracy of precordial VCG ST in noninvasive assessment of ischemic injury in various areas of myocardium and its practicality for clinical application."
"Previous studies have suggested that postjunctional supersensitivity of the vas deferens is due in part to altered electrophysiological properties, the sensitivity of the muscle being increased to any agonist which initiates contraction by means of depolarizing the cell membrane. Results of the present study indicate that altered electrical properties are not the only postjunctional changes which can account for the enhanced response. Dose-response curves for stimulant agonists were obtained in isolated vasa deferentia which were depolarized by a K-rich, Na-free solution. Chronic denervation resulted in a 2- to 3-fold displacement of the dose-response curve for norepinephrine to the left of control. Cocaine (10-(5)M) did not potentiate the response to norepinephrine of the innervated, depolarized smooth muscle. Supporting the contention that the supersensitivity of the depolarized tissue is postjunctional in nature was the finding that the denervated vas deferens was supersensitive to methoxamine, an agent which is not taken up by the neuronal amine transport system. Pretreatment of rats with reserpine (1.0 mg/kg/day for 5-7 days) also produced supersensitivity of the depolarized vas deferens. The increased maximal response to drugs of the denervated rat vas deferens which is observed in normally polarized tissues is absent in depolarized tissues suggesting that the phenomenon of increased maximum requires the existence of a membrane potential in order to be manifest. The denervated vas deferens, but not the vas deferens from reserpine-pretreated animals, exhibits an increase in the duration of drug-induced contractions. This effect occurs in both normal and depolarizing salt solutions suggesting that the change which leads to this phenomenon differs from those alterations which lead to postjunctional supersensitivity and to the enhanced maximal response."
"The effects of splenectomy and sympathetic blockade on cardiac output (Q) response to mild to moderate exercise were studied in chloralose-anesthetized vagotomized dogs during electrically-induced muscular work, which increased oxygen consumption (VO2) 4- to 5-fold. Splenectomy reduced the exercise factor (deltaQ/deltaVO2 ratio) from 5.86 +/- 0.43 (SE) to 3.30 +/- 0.34 (p less than 0.001), while left nephrectomy had no effect. The exercise factor was not affected by beta-adrenoceptor blockade produced by propranolol or practolol, but was reduced by mecamylamine. The spleen did not increase cardiac output by displacing blood into the general circulation because pulmonary artery wedge pressure did not change during exercise in normal dogs. Furthermore, cardiac output was increased 35 +/- 6\% after intraportal infusion of splenic venous blood obtained during exercise, whereas arterial blood infusion increased cardiac output only 10\%. We conclude that the cardiac output rise during exercise in part is caused by the inotropic action of a splenic noncatecholamine substance, which is released by sympathetic stimulation."
"To investigate the hypothalamic responsiveness in obesity, changes in the levels of plasma cortisol and growth hormone (GH) were studied in 11 obese and six normal-weight subjects after hypothalamic alpha-adrenergic stimulation with methoxamine, 20 mg i.v. To allow for dose/body weight differences, five additional obese subjects received 30 mg methoxamine. Plasma GH, cortisol, insulin, free fatty acid and glucose levels were determined during the 3-h infusion of methoxamine. The responses of cortisol and GH were reduced in the obese subjects as compared with the normal-weight subjects. No significant changes in plasma glucose, free fatty acids or insulin were observed in any of the groups. The reduced responses of plasma cortisol ang GH in the obese subjects are considered to be an expression of hypothalamic underresponsiveness, since the stimuli for the secretion of these hormones are at least partially controlled by an alpha-adrenergic mechanism."
"To see the effect of alpha adrenergic receptor stimulation upon in vivo basal secretion of glucagon and insulin, phenylephrine and methoxamine were infused at a dose of 236 pmol/kg/min and 2.36 nmol/kg/min, respectively, for 10 min into the cranial pancreaticoduodenal artery in anesthetized dogs. During the infusion of either drug pancreatic venous blood flow was markedly diminished, resulting in a significant decrease of basal output of both glucagon and insulin. Intrapancreatic administration of the stimulants exerted neglible effects on the plasma levels of both hormones in the systemic circulation. Pretreatment with phentolamine abolished the alpha stimulant-induced inhibition of bihormonal output. Under alpha blockade which per se results effectively in a stimulation of insulin release, basal output of glucagon was not significantly augmented. These results suggest that the alpha receptors on the A cell of the islets may be involved in the similar inhibitor mechanism, but less potently than those on the B cell under basal physiological adrenergic control in the canine."
"Effects of perfusion pressure augmentation with methoxamine on transmural distribution and adequacy of coronary blood flow during cardiopulmonary bypass were investigated. Flow in normal, nonworking canine hearts was measured with tracer microspheres and electromagnetic flow probes while heart rate, myocardial oxygen consumption, left ventricular contractility and epicardial ST-segment stability were monitored. Measurements during normotensive cardiopulmonary bypass were compared with values during intraoperative hypotension and subsequent normotension achieved following methoxamine infusion. Total and regional coronary blood flow returned to levels not different from normotensive controls after methoxamine infusion with a redistribution of flow to the subendocardium. We conclude that elevating perfusion pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass with methoxamine infusion increases total coronary and subendocardial blood flow by means of peripheral and selective subepicardial alpha adrenergic vasoconstriction."
"The phenomenon of "coronary steal," i.e., the shunting of blood from ischemic to normally perfused areas of myocardium, has been described as an effect of the administration of several vasodilating agents. This study was performed to ascertain whether the reverse situation can be induced, i.e., whether vasoconstriction of the vessels supplying the nonischemic zone could increase the collateral flow to the ischemic area. In 16 open chest dogs, 15 and 30 min after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, epicardial electrograms were recorded and regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF) was measured with radiolabeled microspheres. Methoxamine was infused intravenously between 17 and 30 min, the mean arterial pressure being kept constant. The results indicate that while the coronary arterial flow to the normal myocardium fell from 90.6 +/- 4.3 to 77.7 +/- 3.2 ml/min/100 g (P less than 0.01), the collateral blood flow to the ischemic area increased from 21.4 +/- 3.5 to 41.0 +/- 4.2 ml/min/100 g (P less than 0.01), and thereby reduced acute myocardial ischemic injury. This favorable redistribution of blood flow might be considered a "reverse coronary steal.""
"Strength-interval curves, relating an index of the contractile vigor of premature beats to their coupling intervals, were elicited in anesthetized, open-chest dogs prepared for atrial or ventricular pacing and the high-fidelity measurement of left ventricular pressure. During inotropic interventions, changes of the curves were evaluated in terms of the parameters (slopes and intercepts) of their straight lines of best fit. These parameters were altered by isoproterenol, propranolol, and heart rate, and were correlated closely with paired values of isovolumic Vmax (of driven beats). The strength-interval curves were reproducible and were not affected by large changes of venous return or arterial blood pressure. These results provide a basis for the use of strength-interval curves for the evaluation of ventricular contractile state, using fluid-filled catheters for the measurement of left ventricular pressure."
"Phthalazinol (EG-626), a newly synthesized cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, inhibited spontaneous phasic contractions (SPC) of isolated rabbit portal veins in a dose-dependent manner. Phthalazinol at a minimal concentration necessary to completely abolish the SPC did not alter 45Ca-uptake, 45Ca-influx, or the ED50S for methoxamine (me) and K+, but it did reduce the amplitude of the tonic contractions induced by ME and K+ by approximately 25\%. On the other hand, verapamil, and La+3 abolished SPC, ME, and K+-induced contractions. Tetrodotoxin had no effect on SPC or on tonic contractions induced by ME and K+. Since extracellular Ca++ is known to be essential for SPC, ME, and K+-induced contractions in rabbit portal vein, the present results suggest that the abolishment of SPC and the partial inhibition of the ME and K+ responses by phthalazinol may be related to an action of this agent on intracellular Ca++ or Ca++-efflux."
"Rabbit splenic capsular strips release prostaglandins E and F when contracted by noradrenaline or methoxamine. Contractions and prostaglandin release are dose-dependent. Cocaine increases significantly the effect of noradrenaline, but not that of methoxamine, on contraction of the strips and release of prostaglandin E. Release of prostaglandin F was increased by the addition of cocaine not only when noradrenaline was used as an agonist but also at two of three dose levels of methoxamine. When indometacin is added to the bath fluid, it inhibits prostaglandin release and at the same time potentiates the contractile effects of noradrenaline and methoxamine on the rabbit splenic capsular strips. The prostaglandin-synthetase blocker 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid also potentiates the contractions induced by noradrenaline and methoxamine. Both the effects on prostaglandin synthesis and on contraction exerted by indometacin can be reversed, when indometacin is washed out. Exogenous prostaglandins E1, E2 and F2alpha in concentrations up to 150 ng/ml do not influence contractions of the strips induced by either noradrenaline or methoxamine. At higher concentrations prostaglandin E1 decreases, but prostaglandins E2 and F2alpha increase the contractions induced by both agonists. The potentiation of the effects of noradrenaline and methoxamine on rabbit splenic strips by indometacin and 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid cannot be explained by inhibition of uptake1 or uptake2, release of endogenous noradrenaline or inhibition of metabolism of the agonists. It is suggested that the potentiation is caused by inhibition of synthesis of endogenous prostaglandins, although an undefined sensitizing effect of indometacin and 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid cannot be completely exclused."
"A study was carried out of a therapy supporting the anaerobic glycolysis and coronary perfusion of ischemic myocardium and preserving its potassium and magnesium contents, which consisted in combined administration of hyaluronidase, glucose, insulin, Tris, methoxamine, and potassium and magnesium aspartate. The drugs were administered to Beagle dogs between 30 minutes and 20 hours after the ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The size of infarction was determined by the Nachlas method, which is based on the detection of activities of dehydrogenases in heart slices. Treated animals showed a reduced infarction size (p less than 0.001). The evidence of the favourable effect of the therapy used was brought also by hemodynamic measurements. The heart rate was slower (p less than 0.02) and the mean arterial blood pressure was higher (p less than 0.001) in treated animals than in control ones (as evaluated at the end of the experimental period). Significant correlation between the infarction size and the heart rate on the one hand and the mean arterial pressure on the other hand was found (r = 0.59, p less than 0.01; r=--0.47, p less than 0.05, respectively)."
"Chlorpromazine and molindone were tested for their abilities to impair conditioned avoidance behavior of rats. Chlorpromazine was effective within the dose range of 0.3 to 7.0 mg/kg (ID50approximately 2.0 mg/kg); molindone was effective within the range of 0.3 to 5.0 mg/kg (ID50 approximately 0.6 mg/kg). Behaviorally relevant doses of chlorpromazine and molindone were then tested for their effects on blood pressure and on adrenergic mechanisms. When given intravenously to anesthetized, hypertensive animals, both drugs (1.0 mg/kg) produced significant but transient vasodepression. When given intraperitoneally to anesthetized or to conscious hypertensive rats, the drugs did not produce significant effects on blood pressure. Both drugs (1.0 mg/kg) blocked responses to an alpha agonist (methoxamine), but chlorpromazine was significantly more potent than molindone. In addition, chlorpromazine produced a dose-dependent (1.0-10.0 mg/kg) inhibition of 3H-l-norepinephrine uptake into heart, but molindone at the same doses produced no inhibition of uptake. In related experiments, it was found that guanethidine (50 mg/kg) was an effective agent for lowering blood pressure of hypertensive rats. When chlorpromazine (3-10 mg/kg) was administered concomitantly with guanethidine, the blood pressure lowering properties of guanethidine were diminished or abolished. When molindone (1-10 mg/kg) was administered concomitantly with guanethidine, there was no loss of blood pressure control. It is concluded that molindone is an important drug, because it is an antipsychotic agent that does not interact adversely with guanethidine."
"Sympathomimetic agents with mixed and pure alpha and beta adrenergic activity are adsorbed by coconut shell activated carbon from blood, sufficiently rapidly to markedly reduce the activity of these agents. The results of this study suggest that the site of injection of sympathomimetic agents being considered for correcting hypotension during activated carbon hemoperfusion be selected to permit systemic mixing before circulation into the adsorption device."
"Vasoconstriction due to parallel i.a. injections of NA were studied in subcutaneous adipose tissue and gracilis muscle preparations in dogs. The vasoconstrictor response to NA was significantly lower in adipose tissue than in muscle. Only in muscle did acidosis inhibit NA-induced vasoconstriction. The beta-receptor antagonist propranolol increased the vasoconstrictor response in adipose tissue to the level of skeletal muscle. The lack of significant inhibition of NA-induced vasoconstriction in adipose tissue may be due to the simultaneous inhibition of two opposing mechanisms-alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction and beta-adrenergic vasodilatation. After propranolol acidosis inhibited NA-induced vasoconstriction equally in adipose tissue and muscle. The difference between adipose tissue and muscle may thus be due to a greater importance of a beta-adrenergic vasodilator mechanism in the former tissue. The metabolic response to isoprenaline was inhibited by acidosis, while the direct vasodilatation was unaffected. It is suggested that the beta-adrenergic vasodilator mechanism that is inhibited by acidosis is related to the metabolism of the tissue."
"Sodium pentobarbital (PB), 30 mg/kg, iv, was administered to 30 conscious dogs instrumented for measurement of cardiac output and regional blood flow distribution, left ventricular (LV) diameter, LV pressure, dP/dt, and dD/dt, i.e., velocity of myocardial fiber shortening. Ventilation was controlled during anesthesia to maintain arterial blood gases at control values for conscious dogs. The anesthetic produced an initial transient, peripheral vasodilation but the steady state effects 15-30 minutes later were characterized by slight reductions in mesenteric flow and cardiac output and increases in mesenteric and systemic resistances, whereas iliac and renal resistances were not significantly different from control. When heart rate rose, PB increased end-systolic diameter and decreased coronary resistance, LV end-diastolic diameter, dP/dt/P (42\%), and shortening velocity (36\%). When heart rate was controlled, PB still increased end-systolic diameter and decreased shortening velocity and dP/dt/P, as occurred during spontaneous rhythm, but end-diastolic diameter rose instead of falling and coronary resistance did not change. After recovery from bilateral cervical section of both carotid sinus and aortic nerves, PB failed to elicit tachycardia. Thus, PB affects systemic and regional hemodynamics only slightly, but depresses the myocardium markedly. The tachycardia associated with PB anesthesia in intact, trained dogs appears not to be only vagolytic, as previously thought, but is predominantly mediated through the arterial baroreceptor reflex."
"A comparison was made of the effects of vasopressin (ADH), methoxamine (MX), and angiotensin II (AN) on coronary and left ventricular dynamics, cardiac output, and regional blood flow distribution in intact, consci9us dogs. At an equal percent pressure elevation, ADH reduced cardiac output and cardiac rate the most, while AN had the least effect. After denervation of arterial baroreceptors, ADH still reduced heart rate, while AN increased it, suggesting nonbaroreceptor negative and positive chronotropic effects, respectively. A differential pattern on peak dP/dt was also observed, with ACH causing a greater reduction than MX while AN did not decrease dP/dt. With heart rate held constant, AN did not reduce dP/dt, suggesting a direct positive inotropic effect since dP/dt should have fallen slightly due to reflex mechanisms, as was observed with MX and ADH. ADH induced the greatest increase in coronary resistance (140\%), while the least (46\%) was observed with AN, which could be explained, in part, by the differential effects observed on cardiac rate and contractility. The greatest increase in resistance in the iliac bed occurred with ADH (30\%), and the least with AN (34\%). Conversely, the greatest constriction in the renal bed occurred with AN (95\%), and lesser amounts were observed with ADH (36\%) and MX (35\%). Thus ADH, MX, and AN exert potent yet differential vasoconstricting actions on peripheral beds. In addition, while all three agents elicited coronary vasoconstriction, the differential effects on coronary vascular resistance appeared to be due predominantly to a difference in chronotropic and inotropic actions."
"Dogs were trained to intravenously self-administered d-amphetamine (0.05 mg/kg/infusion) until a stable intake per 4 hr daily session was achieved. When the dogs were given noncontingent infusions of d-amphetamine in varying amounts o\% to 100\% of the baseline intake) immediately prior to the session, they decreased their self-administration response rate appropriately so that total drug intake remained constant. However, there were not changes in subsequent responding for d-amphetamine following pretreatment with either the noradrenergic agonist methoxamine (0.5-2.0 mg/kg) or the noradrenergic antagonist phenoxybenzamine (1-8 mg/kg).  Additionally, responding was not maintained when methoxamine (0.05 mg/kg/infusion) was substituted for d-amphetamine. In contrast, pretreatment with either the dopaminergic antagonist pimozide (5-40 mug/kg) or chlorpromazine (0.25-2.0 mg/kg) produced dose-dependent increases in the number of self-administered d-amphetemine infustions. These data suggest that noradrenergic neurotransmission is not responsible for d-amphetamine self-administration, but an intact dopaminergic system does appear to be important."
"The effect of alterations of blood pressure and heart rate on segmental dyskinesis induced by coronary artery ligation and the influence of such manipulations on the magnitude of recovery of the syskinetic segment during subsequent coronary artery reperfusion were evaluated in 77 open-chest dogs. Wall motion was recorded by ultrasound reflected directly from the ischemic myocardial segment. Acute ischemia produced characteristic regional abnormalities in wall motion: aneurysmal bulging occurred during isometric contraction and wall velocity was markedly reduced during ventricular ejection. During 69 minutes of ischemia, a control group of dogs underwent no interventions and showed no further changes in wall motion. Tachycardia induced by atrial pacing during ischemia had no significant effect. Arterial hypertension during ischemia caused a marked reduction in wall velocity when methoxamine was used: 14 plus or minus 2 (SE) mm/sec (ischemia alone) to 6 plus or minus 1 mm/sec (ischemia + drug). In contrast, norepinephrine improved wall velocity: 11 plus or minus 2 mm/sec (ischemia alone) to 25 plus or minus 4 mm/sec (ischemia + drug). Hypertension caused by infusion of phenylephrine gave intermediate results, as did hypotension induced by either nitroprusside or hemorrhage during the ischemic period. After 60 minutes the drugs were stopped, the coronary ligation released, and the ischemic myocardium reperfused. The relative order of improvement of wall velocity with reperfusion was 11 plus or minus 2 mm/sec (ischemia alone) to 24 plus or minus 3 mm/sec (reperfusion) in the group that received norepinephrine, 12 plus or minus 3 mm/sec to 20 plus or minus 3 mm/sec in the control group with no intervention durin ischemia, 13 plus or minus 2 mm/sec to 20 plus or minus 1 mm/sec in the nitroprusside group, 9 plus or minus 2 mm/sec in the phenylephrine group, and 14 plus or minus 2 mm/sec to 12 plus or minus 1 mm/sec in the methoxamine group. The aneurysmal bulging during isometric contraction  also was reduced to a greater degree by reperfusion in the group that received norepinephrine during the ischemic period than it was in the groups undergoing other interventions during ischemia. We conclude that drug-induced elevations in arterial blood pressure can have different effects on the syskinetic motion of acutely ischemic myocardium and on the degree of recovery following reperfusion depending on the particular agent used."
"Lowering the bath temperature from 37 degrees C to 20 degrees C resulted in supersensitivity of the isolated mouse was deferens to norepinephrine. Dose-response curves to norepinephrine were shifted to the left along the log dose axis (enhanced potency) and the maximum degree of contraction that could be elicited was increased. The effect of cocaine on norepinephrine effects was qualitatively the same as hypothermia. Both treatments enhanced the potencies of other alpha receptor agonists that are substrates for the adrenergic neuronal membrane uptake mechanism. Neither treatment enhanced the potency of methoxamine, which is not taken up by adrenergic neurons, but hypothermia increased the methoxamine-induced maximum contractile height. Uptake of 14C-norepinephrine by the vas deferens was abolished by cocaine and low temperature. The data suggest that enhanced potency of adrenergic amines by hypothermia results from an inhibition of uptake by adrenergic neurons. Increased height of maximum contraction at low temperature may be partly due to decreased neuronal uptake, but other mechanisms are also likely to be involved in this effect."
"Chronic postganglionic denervation of the rate vas deferens produces an increase in the sensitivity of the in vitro smooth muscle to norepinephrine, methoxamine, acetylcholine, potassium and electrical stimulation. The maximal contractile response to norepinephrine and acetylcholine is increased but the maximal response to potassium or electrical stimulation is not affected. In addition, the vas deferens becomes spontaneously active after denervation. The spontaneous contractions are not prevented by tetrodotoxin, phentolamine or atropine. The appearance and magnitude of the spontaneous contractions are temporally correlated with the development of postjunctional supersensitivity. At a given time after denervation there is a significant correlation between the magnitude of the spontaneous contractions and the sensitivity to norepinephrine, i.e., the sensitivity to norepinephrine being greatest in those tissues with the largest spontaneous contractions. There is an inverse relationship between the magnitude of the spontaneous contractions and the endogenous norepinephrine concentration. Pretreatment of rats with reserpine (1. 0 mg/kg/day for 5-7 days) results in supersensitivity of the vas deferens ,o norepinephrine and acetylcholine. Those tissues obtained from reserpine-pretreated rats which are supersensitive are also spontaneously active. It is concluded that the -ppearance of spontaneous contractions in the rat vas deferens is an index of postjunctional supersensitivity."
"The effective use of vasoactive drugs in shock requires an understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in the various types and stages of shock and knowledge of the specific pharmacologic effects of each drug in the abnormal state. Vasoactive drugs should be used after the primary and secondary causes of shock have been corrected. Specific vasoactive drugs should be selected on the basis of measured hemodynamic abnormalities."
"Anaphylaxis to suxamethonium in patients who gave no history of allergy is presented in this report. The diagnosis of anaphylaxis was based on a rapid onset of tachycardia, arterial hypotension, erythematous patches and oedema, and a positive reaction to a sensitivity test."
"The perfused central artery of the rabbit ear was less sensitive to extraluminal than to intraluminal noradrenaline, but the reverse was true for metaraminol, methoxamine, metanephrine, and isoproterenol. No difference was noted between the extraluminal and intraluminal potency of phenylephrine. Cocaine potentiated the effect of extraluminal and intraluminal noradrenaline, but decreased that of intraluminal phenylephrine. Irrespective of the route of administration, the constrictor potencies of the sympathomimetic amines were not affected by cocaine. Arteries of reserpine-treated rabbits were supersensitive to extraluminally and intraluminally applied noradrenaline and phenylephrine, but they were not supersensitive to metaraminol. 6-Hydroxydopamine effectively destroyed adrenergic nerve endings of the central ear artery and increased its responses to both extraluminal and intraluminal noradrenaline and phenylephrine. However, only the constrictor potencies of intraluminally applied metaraminol and methoxamine were enhanced by 6-hydroxydopamine. The apparent discrepancies between the results obtained by various procedures that eliminate or impair the nerve uptake process suggest that the difference in the constrictor potency of extraluminal and intraluminal sympathomimetic amines is probably unrelated to their uptake by nerves located in the adventitio-medial junction of the artery."
"Under the conditions of different stimulation frequencies the inotropic effects of the alpha-adrenoceptor stimulationg agents, methoxamine, naphazoling and oxymetazoline were studied on the isolated rabbit papillary muscle. 1. On the papillary muscle stimulated at 0.5 Hz methoxamine in concentrations from 10(-5)M caused a significant and dose-dependent positive inotropic effect. At 10(-3)M methoxamine decreased the developed tension. With increasing frequency of stimulation (0.5--1--1.5Hz), the positive inotropic effect became smaller, while the negative inotropic one was more pronounced. The time course of the disappearance of the negative inotropic effect of methoxamine by washout differed from that of the positive inotropic effect: the negative component disappeared within 30 min, whereas the positive one lasted for about 100 min. The positive inotropic effect of noradrenaline (10(-6)M), in contrast ot that of methoxamine, was not influenced by the frequency under the same conditions of stimulation. Also naphazoline (10(-5)M) caused a significant positive inotropic effect on the papillary muscle stimulated at 0.5 Hz, while oxymetazoline induced exclusively a negative inotropic effect. 2. The positive inotropic effect of metoxamine (10(-4)M) as well as of naphazoline (10(-5)M) evoked at a frequency of 0.5 Hz was abolished by phentolamine (10(-6)M). Methoxamine (10(-4)M) induced a significant negative inotropic effect in the presence of phentolamine. Phentolamine antagonized the positive inotropic effect of methoxamine in a non-competitive manner: the pD2-value was 7.76. 3. In the presence of methoxamine (10(-4)M) the developed tension in the lower range (0.05--1 Hz) of the frequency-force relationship was enhanced, while that in the higher range (greater that 1.5 Hz) was decreased. The enhancement was abolished by phentolamine (10(-6)M). 4. Papaverine (2x10(-5)M) did not affect the positive inotropic effect of methoxamine. 5. The present results show that methoxamine and naphazoline induced a positive inotropic effect via alpha-adrenoceptor in the ventricular myocardium of the rabbit. These effects were caused only at low, but not at high frequencies of stimulation."
"Two rat strains previously shown to differ with respect to behavioral activity, regional brain tyrosine hydroxylase activity, and norepinephrine-elicited accumulation of adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate exhibited differential behavioral responsiveness during the intraventricular infusion of norepinephrine. The results are interpreted in terms of differential catecholamine receptor sensitivity."
"The Bainbridge reflex, i.e., the effect of rapid saline infusion (1.1 +/- 0.1 liters) on heart rate and arterial and atrial blood pressures, was examined in 12 intact conscious dogs; mean arterial blood pressure rose by 33 +/- 3 (SE) mm Hg, mean atrial pressure by 14 +/- 1 mm Hg, and heart rate by 75 +/- 9 beats/min. After beta-receptor blockade, heart rate rose slightly less (+49 +/- 5 beats/min, P = 0.05). Cholinergic blockade, combined cholinergic and beta-receptor, or beta-receptor blockade after vagotomy blocked the heart rate response to the infusion. The rise in heart rate in the face of an increase in arterial blood pressure with volume loading suggested that the arterial baroreceptor reflex was not responding appropriately to the increase in arterial blood pressure. In conscious dogs after denervation of the arterial baroreceptors, the increase in heart rate with volume loading was no greater than that in those dogs with their arterial baroreceptors intact, suggesting that the baroreceptor reflex was not restraining heart rate in the normal response to volume loading. The relationship between the pulse interval (PI) and the systolic arterial blood pressure (SAP) following an intravenous injection of methoxamine was used to evaluate the sensitivity of the baroreceptor reflex in intact conscious dogs. After a mild amount of volume loading, when atrial pressure was 8 +/- 2 mm Hg, the PI/SAP slope was significantly depressed from normal. When atrial pressure was elevated further to 28 +/- 1 mm Hg by volume loading, the slope was further depressed. Thus, arterial baroreflex sensitivity is reduced progressively as atrial pressure is raised by volume loading, an observation that explains how heart rate can rise strikingly in the face of an elevated arterial blood pressure."
"Changes in hemodynamic variables and renin release, induced with both alpha and beta adrenergic agonists, were studied in 5 normal men. Saline (0.9\% NaCl), methoxamine (1.6 and 5.9 mug/kg/min), and isoproterenol (0.015 and 0.026 mug/kg/min) were infused individually in a random order for 30 min. Methoxamine and isoproterenol caused the predicted directionally opposite cardiovascular changes but caused nearly equal and dose-related increases in plasma renin activity, as measured by radioimmunoassay. Saline infusion had no effect. Propranolol (0.125 mg/kg) caused decreases in systolic pressure and heart rate, and a significant decrease in plasma renin activity. Propranolol prevented the renin-releasing effects of isoproterenol and methoxamine, but only the cardiovascular effects of isoproterenol. It appears that alpha or beta agonists stimulate renin release equally in man and that at least one step in renin is propranolol-sensitive. Such sensitivity may be independent of its beta receptor blocking activity."
"Contractions induced by graded intraaterial bolus doses of morphine and acetylcholine were measured in isolated segments of dog intestine perfused via the vasculature with Kreb's solution. Addition of the alpha and beta adrenergic receptor agonist, norepinephrine (0.2 mug/ml) to the perfusion solution decreased the magnitude of contractor responses to acetylcholine slightly and to morphine considerably. The pure alpha adrenergic receptor agonist, methoxamine (50 mug/ml), and the pure beta adrenergic receptor agonist, isoproterenol (5 mug/ml), produced similar effects; marked inhibition of responses to morphine and barely discernable inhibition of responses to acetylcholine. The mild inhibitory effects of these adrenergic amines on responses to acetylcholine are attributed to actions on neural and possibly non-neural adrenergic receptors. Perfusion of intestinal segments with Kreb's solution containing prostaglandin E1 (1 mug/ml) or theophylline (180 mug/ml) resulted in marked decreases in responses to morphine but had no significant effects on responses to acetylcholine. Patterns of inhibition similar to those seen with morphine have been observed previously with 5-hydroxytryptamine, which may mediate the intestinal stimulatory effects of morphine. Since isoproterenol, prostaglandin E1 and theophylline share in common the ability to elevate or maintain intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate, the intestine stimulatory effects of morphine may result from 5-hydroxytryptamine-mediated interference with smooth muscle inhibitory actions of cyclic adenosine monophosphate."
"The vulnerability of aortic strips from 50-52 week old Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls to the inhibitory or relaxing effects of the calcium antagonists verapamil and diazoxide was studied. Verapamil produced concentration-dependent inhibition (antagonism) of KCl, PGE2, and methoxamine-induced contraction of aortic strips from SHR and WKY. KCl and PGE2-induced contraction of SHR tissue were less readily antagonized by verapamil compared to WKY preparations. The reverse was seen with methoxamine-induced contraction. The slope of the verapamil inhibition curve of KCl-induced contraction was significantly steeper for aortic strips form WKY. Verapamil and diazoxide also produced concentration-dependent relaxation of KCl-induced contraction of aortic strips, no significant differences being noted in SHR and WKY responses. Results are compatible with the hypothesis that arterial smooth muscle from SHR is characterized by a more tightly bound pool or source of activator Ca++ which is released by certain agonists. Failure to observe a significant difference in verapamil or diazoxide induced relaxation of KCl contracted tissues from SHR or WKY suggests that in the tonic phase of KCl contraction, transmembrane fluxes of Ca++ in SHR and WKY are equally vulnerable to the Ca++ channel inhibitory effect of the antagonists."
"Controversy exists regarding the mechanism by which catecholamines stimulate renin secretion in vivo. A sensitive rat kidney slice system was utilized to study the direct effects of adrenergic agonists and antagonists on renin release in vitro. Catecholamines were protected from degradation by the addition of ascorbic acid to the incubation medium. Significant dose-related stimulation of renin release was observed with epinephrine and norepinephrine in concentrations from 1.5 times 10(-9) to 1.5 times 10(-7)M and with isoproterenol in concentrations from 2 times 10(-9) to 2 times 10(-7)M. No significant stimulation was seen with 10(-10)M concentrations of the three agents. Methoxamine (10(-6)M) stimulated renin release significantly (P less than 0.01). The stimulation observed with epinephrine, norepinephrine, or isoproterenol was blocked by d,l- and l-propranolol (2 times 10(-4)M) but not by d-ropranolol (2 times 10(-4)M) or phentolamine (9 times 10(-4)M). Methoxamine-induced stimulation was abolished by d,l-propranolol but not by phentolamine. These data  that the in vitro kidney slice system is responsive to physiological concentrations of catecholamines when they are protected from degradation. The results further demonstrate a direct stimulatory role for beta-adrenergic agents on renin release and suggest that alpha-adrenergic effects seen in vivo are mediated indirectly by hemodynamic, vascular, or functional changes in the kidney."
"Several lines of evidence have been found which suggest that a partial depolarization is an important event in the development of postjunctional (nondeviation) supersensitivity in the vas deferens and atrium. In the vas deferens of the guinea pig, experiments with microelectrodes indicate that a depolarization of approximately 10 mV occurs after denervation or decentralization. The time course of the depolarization is the same as the time course of the development of supersensitivity found 7 days after denervation in the rat vas deferens. An analysis of the magnitude of junction potentials in the vas deferens supports the conclusion that changes in adrenergic receptors are not a significant factor in postjunctional supersensitivity. An analysis of membrane potential in guinea pig atria demonstrates a high correlation between the appearance of supersensitivity and a partial depolarization in that tissue alsomit is suggested that chronic interruption of the innervation to smooth or cardiac muscle leads to an alteration in the binding of calcium to the cell membrane and a consequent depolarization. The result is a resting membrane potential closer to the threshold for excitation."
"The effect of postganglionic denervation on the incidence of nexal contacts in the smooth muscle of the rat vas deferens was investigated. The chronically denervated tissue exhibited twice as many nexuses as control. This increase in the incidence of cell contacts may contribute to the supersensitivity and/or the increase in maximum response of the denervated vas deferens. The effects of denervation, decentralization, and pretreatment with reserpine on the concentration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in vasa deferentia of rats and guinea pigs were also investigated. One day after denervation there was a substantial decrease in the endogenous norepinephrine and ATP concentrations. The norepinephrine concentration remained low (less than 10\% of control) throughout subsequent days (up to 14 days) whereas the ATP concentration, after the first postoperative day, rose significantly. The rise in ATP concentration was temporally correlated with the development of postjunctional supersensitivity. Decentralization and pretreatment with reserpine both resulted in a significant increase in ATP concentration which preceded by 2 to 3 days a significant increase in sensitivity of the vas deferens. It appears that a change in the tissue concentration of ATP may be one of the initial events that occurs following interruption of the neural contact to the smooth muscle of the vas deferens."
"The auscultatory signs in 90 subjects with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy are described. The late-onset ejection systolic murmur and its responses to vaso-active manoeuvres reflect a volume-dependent outflow tract obstruction. Late vibrations of the systolic murmur, not uncommonly recorded at the apex, are due to associated mitral incompetence. Non-ejection systolic clicks may occur, and the likely explanation is inequality of the functional length of the mitral chordae tendineae secondary to asymmetrical myocardial hypertrophy. The second heart sound is often abnormal, usually with delay in the aortic component. Some correlation was demonstrated between the relative degrees of left and right ventricular outflow obstruction and the pattern of splitting of the second heart sound. Reversed or partially reversed splitting is usually associated with a more severe left ventricular outflow obstruction. Ejection systolic clicks and early diastolic murmurs occur infrequently, but are not incompatible with the diagnosis of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy."
"Pharmacoangiography has not yet become a routine method to differentiate inflammatory and tumorous processes of the lower extremities. Noradrenalin and Vasoxin was compared in its effect on the peripheral blood vessels in inflammatory and tumourous disease."
"The adrenergic receptors mediating the inhibitory effect of epinephrine on the rat thyroid in vivo have been studied by the use of more specific alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulators, and blocking agents. The effect of methoxamine was similar to that of epinephrine, while isoproterenol stimulated 131-I uptake slightly, and did not alter the ratio of monoiodotyrosine (MIT) to diiodotyrosine (DIT). However, like methoxamine, isoproterenol resulted in a decrease in thyroxine (T4) formation. Phentolamine could partially prevent epinephrine-induced decrease in 131-I uptake and T4 synthesis. The changes in the MIT/DIT ratio could be completely prevented by high doses of phentolamine. Propranolol enhanced the effects of epinephrine. It is concluded that the effect of epinephrine on the rat thyroid in vivo is predominantly alpha-adrenergic, but T4 synthesis may be decreased by stimulation of either receptor."
"Injection of 6-hydroxydopamine via the dorsal vein of the penis results in a marked depletion of the endogenous norepinephrine of the vas deferens. Seven days after pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine there is a shift to the left and increase in maxima of the dose-response curves for norepinephrine and methoxamine. The results indicate that pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine produces denervation of the vas deferens and that the in vitro tissue exhibits both prejunctional and postjunctional supersensitivity."
"The cervical sympathetic nerve stimulated release of norepinephrine (NE) from the rabbit superior cervical ganglion (SCG) was characterized. The quantity of NE released per impulse declined with increasing stimulation frequency over the range of 3/sec to 15/sec. Nerve stimulated NE release was potentiated by 1 micromolar desmethylimipramine and 25 micromolar phenoxylbenzamine and inhibited by 1 micromolar bretylium, 25 micromolar methoxamine and 1 micromolar prostaglandin E1. These results suggest that nerve stimulated NE release in the rabbit SCG occurs from sympathetic fibers which are subject to the same neurosecretory control mechanisms as sympathetic fibers elsewhere in the autonomic nervous system."
"Effects of indomethacin and meclofenamate, inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis, were evaluated in the regulation of renal blood flow in conscious and anesthetized dogs and in tranquilized baboons, instrumented with arterial pressure catheters and renal blood flow probes. Indomethacin, 10 mg/kg, did not alter renal blood flow or resistance significantly in the conscious dog. In the anesthetized dog, however, indomethacin caused a reduction in renal blood flow (25 +/- 3\% of control) and an elevation of renal vascular resistance (45 +/- 8\% of control). Meclofenamate, 4 mg/kg, reduced renal flow (12 +/- 2\%) and increased renal vascular resistance 15 +/- 4\% in conscious dogs. In conscious dogs and tranquilized primates, indomethacin and meclofenamate reduced the reactive hyperemia in the renal bed after 15 s occlusion from a control of 36 +/- 5 ml to 6 +/- 2 ml, and after 45 s occlusion from a control of 98 +/- 9 ml to 17 +/- 5 ml. Methoxamine (10-50 mug/kg per min) and angiotensin II (0.03-0.12 mug/kg per min), infused in graded doses, induced significantly greater renal vasoconstriction in conscious dogs in the presence of indomethacin. Thus, in the conscious animal, prostaglandins appear to play only a minor role in the control of the renal circulation at rest, but are of greater importance in mediating the renal responses to reactive hyperemia and to vasoconstriction."
"The effects of norepinephrine, methoxamine and tryptamine were assessed on the monosynaptic and polysynaptic segmental reflexes in the unanesthetized, decerebrated acute spinal cat. Their selectivity of action was determined by studying the interactions of methoxamine and tryptamine with two antagonists, cyproheptadine and phenoxybenzamine. Potentials were evoked by stimulating either the L7 or S1 dorsal root and were recorded from the corresponding ipsilateral ventral root. Norepinephrine did not affect reflex activity, whereas methoxamine facilitated both the monosynaptic and polysynaptic potentials in a dose-related manner when infused over 20 minutes. Tryptamine facilitated both the monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflex potentials. This increase was dose related for the monosynaptic reflex but not for the polysynaptic reflex. Phenoxybenzamine blocked the facilitatory effects of methoxamine and did not antagonize the effects of tryptamine on the segmental reflex. The facilitatory effects of tryptamine were effectively blocked by cyproheptadine. Cyproheptadine failed to reduce the polysynaptic response to methoxamine, although it partially antagonized the monosynaptic facilitation. These findings demonstrate that methoxamine and tryptamine facilitate the segmental reflex by different modes of action and provide additional evidence for noradrenergic and tryptaminergic systems in the spinal cord."
"The effects of cocaine on responses to supramaximal concentrations of agonists have been studied in preparations of rat vas deferens. Cocaine 10 muM decreased the mean time to peak and increased the mean magnitude of responses to noradrenaline but not to supramaximal field stimulation of sympathetic fibres, to high potassium or to methoxamine. Diphenydramine 10 muM affected responses to noradrenaline similarly. It is proposed that the prejunctional action of cocaine and of diphenhydramine to reduce the rate of neuronal uptake of noradrenaline may provide a sufficient explanation for the enhanced reactivity of the vas deferens to noradrenaline, as this would allow an increased rate of rise of amine concentration at the receptors. Cocaine also enhanced the reactivity of the vas deferens to acetylcholine. The basis of this enhancement by cocaine of the reactivity of the vas deferens to acetylcholine remains to be established, but clearly is not mediated postjunctionally since responses to carbachol were not similarly affected."
"The role played by the major arterial baroreceptor reflexes in the cardiovascular response to exercise was examined by comparing the responses of untethered conscious dogs instrumented for the measurement of aortic pressure and cardiac output with those of dogs with total arterial barorecptor denervation (TABD). Moderately severe levels of exercise (12 mph) in intact dogs increased cardiac output from 111 +/- 17 ml/kg per min, increased heart rate from 101 +/- 5 to 265 +/- 8 beats/min, and reduced total peripheral resistance from 0.039 +/- 0.003 to 0.015 +/- 0.002 mmHg/ml per min. Dogs with TABD responded in a very similar fashion; exercise increased cardiac output from 119 +/- 8 to 356 /+- 23 ml/kg per min, increased heart rate from 122 +/- 7 to 256 +/- 5 beats/min, and decreased total peripheral resistance from 0.042 +/- 0.005 to +/- 0.015 +/- 0.001 mmHg/ml per min. The reflex heart rate responses to intravenous bolus doses of methoxamine were also examined in intact animals, both at rest and during exercise. Methoxamine caused striking bradycardia at rest, but little bradycardia during exercise. These results suggest that the arterial baroreceptor reflex is normally turned off during severe exercise and thus does not modify significantly the cardiovascular response to exercise."
"A patient with the prolapsing mitral valve syndrome demonstrated a most striking early diastolic sound. Noninvasive study with phonocardiograms, external pulse recordings, and echocardiograms lead us to believe that the sound may be related to the initial opening movement of the mitral valve. To our knowledge, such a mechanism for the production of a diastolic sound has not been previously reported."
"Both reserpine and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) pretreatment potentiated the sensitivity of guinea pig aortic strips to norepinephrine (NE), barium, methoxamine and potassium indicating postjunctional supersensitivity. However, cocaine treatmetn only potentiated the NE response indicating prejunctional supersensitivity. 6-OHDA and reserpine-induced supersensitivity but not cocaine-induced supersensitivity was accompanied by an increase in 45Ca influx."
"In anaesthetized rats the baroreflex was checked before and 15 min after i.c.v. administration of 10 micrograms SP. The baroreflex was checked indirectly by relating both the reflex prolongation in heart period (inter-beat-interval: IBI) and the reflex inhibition of SNA to a pharmacologically induced BP rise. After i.c.v. administration of SP (n = 10) the resting values of the BP increased significantly from 73 +/- 16 mm Hg to 86 +/- 9 mm Hg (diastolic pressure) and from 98 +/- 20 mm Hg to 113 +/- 14 mm Hg (systolic pressure) whilst in the control group (n = 14) the BP remained constant (63 +/- 9 vs 63 +/- 7 mm Hg diastolic pressure and 106 +/- 12 vs 106 +/- 9 mm Hg systolic pressure). In the experimental group the resting value in IBI was shortened significantly from 218 +/- 40 ms to 167 +/- 28 ms (controls: 218 +/- 22 ms vs 218 +/- 18 ms) and the SNA (estimated in arbitrary units) rose significantly by about 50\% in relation to the reference period before i.c.v. SP (3.31 +/- 0.11 vs 6.27 +/- 0.17 arbitrary units per IBI). In contrast, the baroreflex behaved similarly before and after any treatment, i.e. both the reflex prolongation in IBI (1.34 +/- 0.75 vs 1.39 +/- 0.95 ms/mm Hg) and the reflex inhibition of SNA (0.0312 +/- 0.01 vs 0.0555 +/- 0.015 arbitrary units/mm Hg) caused by that pharmacologically induced BP rise were comparable before and after i.c.v. SP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Several experimental models of torsades de pointes have been proposed these last years. They can be classified in 2 categories: morphological models designed to reproduce the ECG features of "torsade", with in vivo ventricular stimulations or with computer ECG stimulations and pharmacological models designed to obtain in vivo early after depolarizations, with toxic agents such as cesium chloride and anthopleurine, or with commercialized or new pharmaceutical drugs. These models improved electrophysiologic and pharmacologic knowledge of torsades de pointes. The respective roles of early after depolarizations in torsades initiation and of reentry in the following beats of the salvos is now recognized. Induction protocols were described, which appeared to involve an inotropic potentiation following burst or repetitive extrastimuli. A more accurate evaluation of arrhythmogenic risk associated with new drugs could be developed."
"Cl transport mechanisms in polarized cultures of canine tracheal epithelium were examined using an Ussing-type chamber with independent mucosal and serosal perfusion. Cl activity was monitored continuously from fluorescence of entrapped 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)quinolinium (SPQ). When added to the serosal (but not mucosal) solution, isoproterenol increased Cl fluxes across the apical membrane Cl more than fourfold. Apical Cl transport was sensitive to diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (DPC) but not to furosemide, whereas basolateral membrane Cl transport was sensitive to furosemide but not to DPC. Based on a mathematical model of Cl transport, we developed a sensitive protocol to measure hormone-sensitive Cl transport. In Cl-loaded cells in which basolateral Cl transport was partially inhibited by furosemide, mucosal Cl removal caused no Cl efflux before but rapid efflux (0.25 mM/s) after addition of isoproterenol or chlorophenylthio-cAMP. In the presence of indomethacin to block prostaglandin production, elevation of intracellular Ca by bradykinin or 4-bromo-A23187 did not cause Cl efflux, nor did Ca buffering with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid affect stimulation by the cAMP pathway. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate increased Cl efflux submaximally (0.09 mM/s) but did not affect maximal stimulation by cAMP agonists. Methoxamine did not alter apical or basolateral membrane Cl transport.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"To test the hypothesis that the release of neurohypophyseal peptides into plasma in humans is stimulated by a central nervous system (CNS) alpha 1 adrenergic mechanism, we measured the responses of arginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT) to intravenous methoxamine, an alpha 1 agonist which enters the CNS following peripheral administration. The potential confound of baroreceptor inhibition of AVP release by the pressor effect of methoxamine was addressed by measuring the plasma AVP response to infusion of norepinephrine (NE), an alpha 1 agonist which does not enter the CNS and which produced an equivalent pressor effect. We also assessed the pituitary adrenocortical system responses to methoxamine and norepinephrine infusions by measuring plasma ACTH and cortisol concentrations. In addition, plasma NE and epinephrine were measured. Methoxamine, but not NE, increased plasma AVP compared to placebo infusion. Neither methoxamine nor NE affected plasma OT. The AVP elevation was delayed until more than 60 min after the methoxamine infusion began and the peak AVP level occurred 30 min after cessation of the infusion. In contrast, ACTH and cortisol increased early during methoxamine infusion and ACTH returned to baseline promptly after the infusion ceased. Although it is possible that the AVP response to methoxamine reflected stimulation of AVP release at a CNS level, it is also possible that the AVP increase represented a rebound response to withdrawal of methoxamine."
"Closed chest massage and tracheal intubation are not enough. The 70\% success rate promised by Kouwenhoven 31 years ago is not realised. Coronary perfusion pressure is the main goal. To achieve this a proposal of a combined new CPR is advocated which encompass the following items besides closed chest massage and tracheal intubation: (a) use of high dose methoxamine (instead of epinephrine), (b) use of continuous abdominal pressure (instead of intermittent pressure), (c) unloading the pump, which means no use of any intravenous fluids, and (d) intracardiac injection of medications until restarting of spontaneous circulation."
"1. Eight healthy subjects inhaled nedocromil sodium from a metered-dose inhaler using a standardised inspiratory technique. Blood samples were taken for up to 270 min after inhalation for radioimmunoassay of plasma nedocromil sodium concentrations. 2. To investigate the possibility that respiratory manoeuvres can alter the absorption of the drug from the lungs, on the first (control) study day at 70 min after dosing, subjects performed nine forced expiratory manoeuvres over a 3 min period. At 110 min after dosing, subjects took a slow, full inspiration with a 30 s breath-hold, and at 150 min after dosing the subjects performed one single forced expiration. 3. On the second study day, subjects inhaled methoxamine, 0.15 mg kg-1 of a 20 mg ml-1 solution at 60 min after dosing, and the study continued as above. On the third day, subjects repeated the sequence of respiratory manoeuvres, after having taken phenoxymethyl penicillin and probenecid by mouth for 48 h. 4. Both multiple forced expirations and the deep inspiration with breath-hold produced significant increases in the absorption of nedocromil sodium. Inhaled methoxamine did not alter airway calibre or the response to the respiratory manoeuvres. Probenecid, but not penicillin, was detected in the subjects' plasma, and had the effect of increasing the rise in plasma nedocromil sodium concentrations after the multiple forced expirations when compared with the control day. 5. These data suggest that disruption of epithelial tight junctions induced by the respiratory manoeuvres leads to enhanced paracellular transport of nedocromil sodium into the draining circulation of the airways and alveoli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"The present experiments were designed to investigate structure-function relationships, and identify the receptor subtype and postreceptor cellular mechanisms that mediate the ovarian hormone-dependent, excitatory, and inhibitory effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY) on LH release in female rats. Intracerebroventricular administration of NPY decreased plasma concentrations of LH in ovariectomized, hormonally untreated rats but stimulated LH release in ovariectomized rats pretreated with estradiol benzoate and progesterone. A similar dual response was also obtained after administration of NPY2-36. However, deletion of additional amino acids at the N terminus, as in NPY5-36, NPY11-36, NPY16-36, and NPY25-36, rendered the peptides inactive. An N-terminal fragment, NPY1-24-amide, and a discontinuous NPY analog, NPY1-4-epsilon-amino-caproic acid-25-36, similarly failed to influence LH release. The analog [Leu31,Pro34]NPY, a preferential agonist at the Y-1 NPY receptor subtype, also elicited the dual LH responses, but the preferential Y-2 receptor agonist, NPY13-36, was completely inactive. Further, only the peptides that stimulated LH release in vivo, i.e. NPY, NPY2-36, and [Leu31,Pro34]NPY, also stimulated the release of LHRH from median eminence fragments of steroid-primed rats in vitro, and the excitatory effect of [Leu31,Pro34] NPY was blocked by a noncompetitive NPY receptor antagonist, D-myo-inositol-1,2,6-trisphosphate. With the exception of NPY1-24-amide, all of the NPY fragments tested bound specifically to NPY binding sites in hypothalamic membrane preparations, but the highest binding affinities were found for the peptides that evoked biological responses in the in vivo and in vitro tests. Further analysis of the mode of action of NPY showed that the stimulation of LHRH release in vitro was unaffected by omission of Ca2+ from the incubation medium, but was prevented by two antagonists of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid 8-(diethylamino)octyl ester and ryanodine. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis with indomethacin blocked the stimulatory effect of the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist methoxamine on LHRH release, but not the increase produced by NPY.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
"In addition to mossy fibers and climbing fibers, the cerebellar cortex receives noradrenergic and cholinergic afferents. Since the Purkinje (P) cells of the cerebellar vermis (culmen) respond to roll tilt of the animal with a discharge pattern that is out of phase with respect to that of the related lateral vestibular neurons, thus exerting a facilitatory influence on the gain of the vestibulospinal (VS) reflex, we tested the effects of local microinjection into the anterior vermis of noradrenergic and cholinergic agents on these reflexes. In decerebrate cats, unilateral microinjection in the paramedial zone B of the culmen of 0.25 microliters of small doses of alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and beta-noradrenergic agonists (i.e., metoxamine, clonidine, and isoproterenol, respectively) increased the response gain (in impulses/second per deg) of the EMG response of the ipsilateral and to some extent also of the contralateral triceps brachii to animal tilt (at 0.15 Hz, +/- 10 degrees). On the other hand local injection of the corresponding antagonists (i.e., prazosin, yohimbine, and propranolol) either decreased the gain of the ipsilateral triceps brachii to labyrinth stimulation or else prevented the occurrence of the effects induced by the corresponding agonists. An increase in gain of the VS reflexes was also elicited in other experiments by unilateral microinjection either of the nonselective cholinergic agonist carbachol or of the anticholinesterase eserine sulfate. Thus, the effects could be produced by increasing the naturally present amount of acetylcholine. Further experiments indicated that a bilateral increase in the response gain of the triceps brachii to labyrinth stimulation occurred after microinjection of a selective muscarinic (bethanechol) or nicotinic agonist (nicotine), while just the opposite result was obtained after microinjection of the corresponding muscarinic (scopolamine) and nicotinic (hexamethonium, D-tubocurarine) blockers. The effects of the noradrenergic and cholinergic agonists, which persisted for about two hours after the injection, were site specific and dose dependent. It appears, therefore, that the noradrenergic and cholinergic afferents to the cerebellar vermis intervene in the gain regulation of the VS reflexes, possibly by increasing the amplitude of modulation of the P cells to labyrinth stimulation."
"It has been suggested that the endothelin (ET) ETB receptor could mediate endothelium-dependent vasodilation to ET-1 or ET-3, but its in vivo role is still largely unknown. We used sarafotoxin S6C, a selective agonist of the ETB receptor, to study the in vivo effects of ETB stimulation. SRTX S6C induced a transient decrease in blood pressure, followed by a long-lasting pressor response accompanied by a marked renal and mesenteric vasoconstriction. No constriction was observed in isolated mesenteric arteries in vitro, indicating that the in vivo vasoconstrictor effect is most likely indirect. The pressor effect of SRTX S6C was not dependent on central stimulation of ETB receptors and was not mediated by catecholamines from the adrenal medulla, prostanoids or ET-1."
"alpha 1-Adrenoceptor activation can enhance myocardial contractility, and two possible inotropic mechanisms are an increase in myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity and action potential prolongation, which can increase net Ca2+ entry into cells. In adult rat ventricular myocytes (bath Ca2+, 1 mM; stimulated at 0.2-0.5 Hz), the drug 4-aminopyridine and the whole-cell voltage clamp have been used to control Ca2+ entry and differentiate between the two mechanisms. At 22-23 degrees C the specific alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine (100 microM) prolonged action potential duration at 50\% repolarization from 55 +/- 2 to 81 +/- 5 msec, delayed time to peak contraction, and increased shortening amplitude from 5.3 +/- 0.6 to 7.8 +/- 1 microns (n = 18). Reduction of the transient outward current and other K+ currents by methoxamine was the major cause of action potential prolongation in rat myocytes with little change in the L-type calcium current. Block of the transient outward current with 2 mM 4-aminopyridine prolonged action potential duration from 52 +/- 6 to 98 +/- 12 msec and increased unloaded cell shortening from 2.9 +/- 0.4 to 6.6 +/- 0.6 microns (n = 4). Subsequently, methoxamine no longer increased cell shortening, although significant potentiation of twitch amplitude was still seen after a brief rest interval. In voltage-clamp experiments, with 70-500-msec pulses, although membrane currents were reduced, methoxamine had no positive inotropic effect and reduced cell shortening from 5.3 +/- 0.7 to 4.97 +/- 0.8 microns at pulse potentials positive to -40 mV. Similar alpha 1-adrenoceptor responses were observed at 35 degrees C during action potential and voltage-clamp experiments, which could be blocked by 10 microM prazosin. In myocytes loaded with the Ca2+ indicator indo-1, alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation or 4-aminopyridine both increased cell contraction and intracellular Ca2+ transients by similar amounts. As in unloaded cells, prior exposure to 4-aminopyridine prevented any inotropic effect of methoxamine without changing the systolic intracellular Ca2+ transient. The results indicated that under our experimental conditions positive inotropy in rat cardiomyocytes on exposure to alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists was strongly correlated with the action potential prolongation that accompanied K+ current reduction. In addition, modulation of K+ channels could occur independent of changes in contractility and/or [Ca2+]i."
"The potential roles of adrenergic and noradrenergic terminals in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus in the regulation of blood glucose and free fatty acids, the two major metabolic fuels, were examined. Corticosterone was also measured, both to assess the specificity of any effects for metabolic fuels, and because endogenous catecholamines in this site have previously been implicated in corticosterone regulation. In the first experiment adult male albino rats having chronically implanted guide cannulae aimed at the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus or the caudate nucleus received microinjections of the agonists methoxamine (alpha 1), clonidine (alpha 2), and isoproterenol (beta) (0, 10, 30, 100 nmol/500 nl), and blood samples were taken from the tail tip. In the second experiment a different set of rats received 30 nmol clonidine or vehicle subcutaneously instead of brain microinjections. Intracranial clonidine and isoproterenol produced marked and moderate hyperglycemia, respectively; methoxamine did not alter glucose. For neither clonidine nor isoproterenol was there any difference in hyperglycemia as a function of microinjection site; also, subcutaneous clonidine injections produced the same peak glucose response as was found after both paraventricular and caudate nucleus microinjections of the same dose. Free fatty acid levels were increased by clonidine and isoproterenol, but slightly suppressed by methoxamine; the alpha agonist effects, but not the beta agonist effect, were greater after paraventricular microinjections than after caudate microinjections. Corticosterone was increased by both alpha agonists after paraventricular but not after caudate nucleus microinjections; beta agonist microinjections into the paraventricular and caudate nuclei produced equivalent corticosterone elevations. These results suggest that most, if not all, of the hyperglycemic effects of alpha and beta adrenergic agonist microinjection into the paraventricular nucleus can be ascribed to leakage of the material into the vasculature, with subsequent action at a distant site. In contrast, all 3 agonists seem capable of acting within the brain to alter free fatty acid levels. The effects on corticosterone of both the alpha 1 and alpha 2 agonists, but not the beta agonist, also appear due, at least in part, to actions within the brain. Previous suggestions that catecholamine terminals in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus are directly and strongly involved in metabolic fuel regulation may require reconsideration."
"Studies with cell homogenates and cultures had indicated earlier that nitric oxide (NO) synthase is dependent on tetrahydrobiopterin, which apparently functions as a cofactor for the enzyme. The present results showed a vasodilator response to tetrahydrobiopterin in precontracted aorta, which is attained via an increase of the intracellular cyclic GMP level. Furthermore, L-Ng-nitro-arginine-methyl ester inhibits the tetrahydrobiopterin-induced vasodilation, showing the involvement of NO synthase."
"The role of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors in the secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) during stress was studied by immunohistochemical analysis of the CRH content of the median eminence (ME) after intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist, methoxamine, or the antagonist, prazosin, in rats pretreated with colchicine. Immunohistochemical staining was performed by the peroxidase technique on 40 microns free-floating sections using a polyclonal antibody specific for CRH. In the first experimental model, rats were implanted with icv cannulae and adapted to the experimental conditions by daily handling and icv injection of artificial CSF. Colchicine (75 micrograms) was administered through the cannulae 6 h before the experiment, conditions in which axonal transport was blocked with little change in basal immunostaining. Two hours after immobilization stress or a single injection of methoxamine (100 micrograms, icv), there was a marked decrease in CRH immunoreactivity throughout the ME, reflecting release of the neuropeptide into the portal circulation. The decrease in CRH immunostaining following immobilization was largely prevented by icv injection of the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, prazosin. In the second experimental model, rats were sacrificed 48 h after icv colchicine injection, conditions in which colchicine acts as a stressor and causes marked depletion of irCRH from the ME. This chronic effect of colchicine was also partially prevented by administration of prazosin, 400-ng injection 5 min prior to colchicine, followed by a continuous icv mini-pump infusion of prazosin, indicating that alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation contributes to the action of colchicine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"In isolated Tyrode-perfused rat kidneys, the release of the cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP was measured in response to several vasodilators, including nitric oxide (NO). During vasoconstrictions induced by methoxamine, a basal release of both cyclic nucleotides was detected in the renal effluent (357 +/- 32 fmol/min for cGMP and 3097 +/- 219 fmol/min for cAMP). Injection of acetylcholine (ACh; 11 nmol), sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 0.8 nmol) and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF; 80 pmol) caused a marked release of cGMP. The cGMP release induced by ACh was not altered by indomethacin (3 microM) but was markedly reduced by the NO synthase inhibitor nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA; 200 microM). Authentic NO (0.16-80 nmol) caused dose-dependent vasodilatations that were accompanied by increases in the overflow of cGMP. The vasodilatations caused by forskolin (6 nmol) and prostacyclin (PGI2; 3-52 nmol) were not accompanied by an overflow of cGMP. The vasodilator responses to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; 0.25-2 mumol), obtained in presence of the 5-HT2 receptor blocker ritanserin (10 nM) and the 5-HT3 blocker ICS 205930 (10 nM), were markedly reduced by L-NNA; however, they were not accompanied by the renal release of cGMP. Both forskolin and PGI2 induced the release of cAMP from perfused rat kidneys; ACh, 5-HT and 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) also evoked a significant release of cAMP into the renal effluent. The release of cAMP induced by ACh and 5-HT was reduced by indomethacin and L-NNA. Higher doses of NO released cAMP from the perfused rat kidneys. Our data illustrate that both cAMP and cGMP can be released by vasodilator substances into the venous effluent of isolated perfused rat kidneys. The dilator responses to 5-HT were sensitive to the NO synthase inhibitor L-NNA and were accompanied by the release of cAMP and not by the release of cGMP. Our data suggest that the dilator responses may be due to NO released from endothelial cells, which then activates adenylyl cyclase either directly or indirectly."
"Rabbit isolated iris dilator strips were contracted by norepinephrine, an alpha 1A- and alpha 1B-nonselective agonist, but not by methoxamine, an alpha 1A-selective agonist. The concentration-response curve for norepinephrine was considerably inhibited by chloroethylclonidine. The pA2 values for WB4101 and 5-methylurapidil were 8.16 +/- 0.09 and 7.84 +/- 0.08 (means +/- S.E. of 8-12 experiments), respectively, and significantly smaller than the values reported in the rat renal artery and thoracic aorta, and rabbit bronchus, where the alpha 1A-subtype is predominant. These results suggest that the rabbit iris dilator contains primarily the alpha 1B-subtype. Clonidine and tizanidine did not contract the rabbit iris dilator but shifted the curve for norepinephrine in a parallel manner, suggesting that they interact with the alpha 1B-subtype and act as competitive antagonists in this muscle. Methoxamine (up to 10(-3) M) had no effect on the contractile response to norepinephrine, suggesting that methoxamine does not interact with the alpha 1B-subtype."
"The release of endogenous ATP and [3H]noradrenaline, and the mechanical response of the guinea-pig vas deferens to field stimulation of its motor nerves were examined using a perfusion system. The release of ATP at rest was 0.83 +/- 0.13 pmol/g per min, and ATP released by field stimulation (8 Hz, 480 shocks) was 5.47 +/- 1.23 pmol/g. The evoked release was completely inhibited when Ca2+ was removed and 1 mM EGTA was added, or by 1 microM tetrodotoxin. The release of ATP and [3H]noradrenaline in response to field stimulation was constant with an S2/S1 ratio of 1.10 +/- 0.11 for ATP and 0.92 +/- 0.03 for [3H]noradrenaline, respectively (where S1 and S2 are stimulation periods). Prazosin (1 microM), a potent alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, significantly reduced the stimulation-evoked release of ATP by 75\% and significantly reduced both mechanical twitch and tonic responses, but enhanced the release of [3H]noradrenaline. This finding indicates that there is an alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated release of endogenous ATP. However, the prazosin-insensitive portion of ATP release (25\%) is considered to be of presynaptic origin. The stimulation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors by 1-noradrenaline or methoxamine in concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 microM resulted in a concentration-dependent release of ATP and a biphasic contraction of the vas deferens: a twitch response was followed by a tonic contraction. Prazosin (1 microM) completely prevented the effect of 1-noradrenaline or methoxamine on both ATP release and mechanical response. When Ca2+ was omitted and EGTA (1 mM) was added, 1-noradrenaline was still able to release ATP but failed to produce contraction. Nifedipine, a Ca-channel and ATP receptor antagonist, reduced the twitch contraction and enhanced the release of ATP from muscle in response to noradrenaline administration. This finding indicates that the release of ATP from the muscle is not linked to mechanical contraction. When the vas deferens was made deficient in noradrenaline by 6-hydroxydopamine pretreatment (100 + 250 mg/kg, i.p.), electrical field stimulation failed to release [3H]noradrenaline and ATP. Under these conditions, exogenous 1-noradrenaline was much more effective in releasing ATP from the smooth muscle, and producing twitch responses, followed by a tonic contraction. After reserpine pretreatment (2 x 5 mg/kg, i.p.), the field stimulation-evoked release of ATP and both phases of contraction were markedly reduced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
"The preoptic area is known to regulate sleep-wakefulness and body temperature. It was suggested earlier that though sleep-wakefulness and body temperature may affect each other, the preoptic area mediated influence on those two physiological phenomena is likely to be independent of alteration in each other. Since intrapreoptic area norepinephrine could modulate both those functions, study of that system was undertaken. It was hypothesized that since the preoptic area has different types of norepinephrinergic receptors (viz. alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta), independent modulation of those two functions was probably due to activation or inactivation of separate receptors. Hence, the effects of different agonist and antagonist of those receptors individually as well as in combination into the preoptic area were studied on those two functions in freely moving rats. The results suggest that norepinephrine induced preoptic area mediated influence on the body temperature is primarily regulated by the alpha 1 receptors while the sleep and wakefulness are regulated by alpha 2 and beta receptors, respectively. The finding should help in explaining several poorly understood observations reported earlier and it suggests that similar phenomena may possibly exist in other system involving other neurotransmitters as well."
"alpha 1-Adrenoceptor agents with alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes sensitive and insensitive to inactivation by chloroethylclonidine were characterized in single cells prepared from rabbit thoracic aorta. WB 4101, 5-methylurapidil and spiperone interacted with high- and low-affinity sites labeled by [3H]prazosin. Chloroethylclonidine 10 microM pretreatment eliminated the low-affinity sites of displacement curves obtained with WB 4101 and 5-methylurapidil but had no effect on the high-affinity site for these agents. The treatment also reduced the site of the displacement curve obtained with spiperone but eliminated only the high-affinity site. Methoxamine and clonidine, alpha-adrenoceptor agonists, interacted with binding sites labeled by [3H]prazosin. The displacement curve for methoxamine was not affected by chloroethylclonidine 10 microM pretreatment, while that for clonidine was partially eliminated by the same type of pretreatment. These results suggest that, in single cells prepared from rabbit thoracic aorta: (1) WB 4101, 5-methylurapidil and spiperone interact with differing affinity at sites labeled by [3H]prazosin; (2) chloroethylclonidine-sensitive and -insensitive [3H]prazosin binding sites correspond to those with low- and high-affinity sites for WB 4101 and 5-methylurapidil, and a high- and low-affinity for spiperone, respectively; and (3) chloroethylclonidine treatment was shown to have no effect on the displacement curve of methoxamine but a partial effect on that of clonidine."
"Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and noradrenaline (NA) have been previously shown to promote glycogenolysis in mouse cerebral cortex (Magistretti, 1990). This action, which is fully expressed within a few minutes, is exerted on astrocytes (Sorg and Magistretti, 1991). In the present article, we report a second, temporally delayed, action of VIP or NA in primary cultures of mouse cerebral cortical astrocytes; thus, following glycogenolysis, an induction of glycogen resynthesis is observed, resulting, within 9 hr, in glycogen levels that are 6-10 times higher than those measured before the application of either neurotransmitter. This effect of VIP or NA is concentration dependent and, for NA, is mediated by adrenergic receptors of the beta subtype. The continued presence of the neurotransmitter is not necessary for this long-term effect, since pulses as short as 1 min result in the doubling of glycogen levels 9 hr later. The induction of glycogen resynthesis triggered by VIP or NA is dependent on protein synthesis, since both cycloheximide and actinomycin D abolish it entirely. The ability to elicit glycogenolysis is not sufficient per se to trigger the induction of glycogen resynthesis. Thus, two glycogenolytic agents such as methoxamine, an alpha 1-adrenergic agonist, and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, both acting via protein kinase C activation, are unable to induce glycogen resynthesis. This observation, taken together with the fact that dibutyryl-cAMP application also results in enhanced glycogen resynthesis, strongly suggests that the long-term effect of VIP or NA is mediated by the cAMP second-messenger pathway.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Separate genes for alpha-1A and alpha-1B adrenoceptors have now been identified. Whereas alpha-1 adrenoceptors are known to mediate rat renal vasoconstriction, the relative importance of these alpha-1 adrenoceptor subtypes was unknown. We cannulated the right suprarenal artery of anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats to permit administration of the alpha-1A and alpha-1B alkylating antagonists, SZL-49 (SZL) and chloroethylclonidine (CEC), respectively, directly into the right kidney. Treated kidneys were homogenized to identify the doses of SZL and CEC that caused the maximum reductions in Bmax for [3H]prazosin, the relatively nonselective alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist. In other rats, a Doppler flow probe was placed around the right renal artery, and dose-peak response curves for boluses of the alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (PHE) were generated before and after supramaximal dosages of SZL or CEC. Renal vasoconstriction to PHE was nearly obliterated by SZL. In contrast, CEC caused only a modest rightward shift in the PHE DRC. SZL also abolished the renal vascular response to two other alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonists, cirazoline and methoxamine. Our data support the conclusion that the alpha-1 adrenoceptors at the level of the rat renal resistance vessels are predominantly alpha-1A adrenoceptors."
"We developed an experimental in vitro model to detect a very small amount of endogenous noradrenaline (NA) released from the rat gastric sympathetic nerve terminals. The stomach was perfused via celiac artery with modified Krebs-Ringer solution containing 10 mM pargyline and 0.1\% bovine serum albumin at a constant flow of 4 ml/min. The right greater splanchnic (SPL) nerve (preganglionic nerve of the gastric sympathetic nerve) was stimulated electrically with square-wave pulses of 2 msec duration and supramaximal intensity (5 mA) for 1 min. The rat stomach contained about 750 ng of NA and spontaneous overflow was about 0.05\% of tissue content per 2 min. The NA overflow induced by SPL nerve stimulation at 5 Hz was abolished by tetrodotoxin (3 x 10(-7) M) and by Ca(++)-free medium containing 2 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid. Hexamethonium (5 x 10(-4) M) significantly decreased the NA overflow induced by SPL nerve stimulation at 5 Hz. Yohimbine (10(-7) and 10(-6) M) and prazosin (10(-7) and 10(-6) M) dose-dependently enhanced the NA overflow induced by SPL nerve stimulation at 5 Hz. Clonidine (10(-7) and 10(-6) M) and methoxamine (10(-5) M) significantly decreased the NA overflow induced by SPL nerve stimulation at 1 Hz and this methoxamine-induced inhibition was abolished by 8-(p-sulfophenyl)-theophylline (5 x 10(-5) M).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"A role for phospholipase C (PLC) hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) as a mechanism of alpha 1-adrenergic signal transduction in human airway epithelial cells (AEC) was investigated in isolated normal tracheal and cystic fibrosis (CF) nasal epithelial cells grown in in vitro culture and prelabeled with 3 muCi myo-[3H]inositol/ml for 72 h. Breakdown of polyphosphoinositides was measured using thin-layer chromatography to detect phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP), and PIP2. Inositol phosphates were separated by ion-exchange column chromatography. In normal AEC, the addition of the endogenous catecholamine l-epinephrine produced a rapid, transient accumulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and inositol 1,4-bisphosphate (IP2) and breakdown of PIP and PIP2. IP3 increased 1.7-fold and IP2 1.6-fold after 20 and 40 s, respectively. A maximal decrease of 35\% PIP2 and 30\% PIP is observed after 20 and 40 s, respectively. The effects of l-epinephrine were not blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist dl-propranolol but were mimicked by the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist methoxamine. Prazosin, an alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, and pertussis toxin (PTX) blocked the effects of l-epinephrine and methoxamine. Addition of l-epinephrine and methoxamine to CF nasal epithelial cells also induced prazosin-sensitive polyphosphoinositide breakdown and inositol phosphate accumulation. A 2.2-fold accumulation of IP3 was observed after 10 s and 2.0-fold increase in IP2 after 20 s. Maximal decreases of 32\% PIP2 and 23\% PIP levels were observed after 20-s incubation with l-epinephrine. PTX reduced the effects of l-epinephrine and significantly blocked the effects of methoxamine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"The purpose of the present study was to investigate the contribution of pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive guanine nucleotide (G) proteins in the pulmonary vascular response to adenosine and ATP in the intact cat under conditions of controlled pulmonary blood flow and left atrial pressure. Adenosine, ATP, and beta-tau-ATP increased lobar arterial pressure in a dose-dependent manner. The pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to adenosine was abolished by BW 1433U, a specific purinergic receptor (P1) inhibitor, PTX pretreatment, indomethacin, and ONO 3708, a thromboxane A2 (TxA2) receptor antagonist. These data suggest that the pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to adenosine depends on activation of P1 purinergic receptors coupled to PTX-sensitive G proteins and subsequent metabolism of liberated arachidonic acid to form TxA2. Because each blocking agent studied produced similar reductions in the pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to ATP without altering the pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to beta-tau-ATP, the present data suggest that ATP constricts the pulmonary vascular bed, in part, by hydrolysis to adenosine. Moreover, the present study suggests that both A1 purinoceptors that are linked to PTX-sensitive G proteins as well as P2x purinoceptors receptors that are independent of PTX-insensitive G proteins mediate the pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to ATP in vivo."
"The susceptibility of female Lewis (LEW/N) rats to the development of streptococcal cell wall (SCW)-induced arthritis and other autoimmune phenomena is associated with the inability of their hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to adequately respond to inflammatory stimuli. In contrast, resistance to the development of SCW-induced arthritis and other inflammatory autoimmune manifestations in histocompatible female Fischer rats (F344/N) is related to their intact HPA axis response to inflammatory mediators. To evaluate the mechanism and the specificity of the HPA axis defect in LEW/N rats, we examined the ability of three major excitatory neurotransmitter systems to activate the HPA axis in both Lewis and Fisher rats. The responsiveness of plasma ACTH and corticosterone to the cholinergic muscarinic receptor agonist arecoline, the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor agonist methoxamine and the serotonin (5-HT) type 2 receptor agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)2-aminopropane were significantly blunted and/or abolished in LEW/N compared to F344/N rats. To localize the HPA axis defect to the hypothalamic CRH neuron, we evaluated the ability of explanted hypothalami from the two strains to secrete immunoreactive CRH in vitro, in response to acetylcholine (ACh), norepinephrine (NE), 5-HT and the 5-HT agonist quipazine. LEW/N hypothalami released less immunoreactive CRH (iCRH) in response to ACh, NE, 5-HT and quipazine than F344/N hypothalami. The dose-response curves of these compounds in the former were shifted to the right and/or abolished, suggesting decreased sensitivity of LEW/N hypothalami to these neurotransmitters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"The effects of capsaicin on nonadrenergic, noncholinergic depressor responses to spinal cord stimulation were studied in pithed rats. Mean blood pressure (MBP was maintained at a level of 100 mmHg by continuous infusion of methoxamine and hexamethonium to block autonomic outflow. Electrical stimulation of the lower thoracic region (T9-12) via a pithing rod produced a frequency (1-8 Hz)-dependent fall in elevated MBP. The depressor response was abolished by tetrodotoxin, whereas atropine, propranolol, and cimetidine plus pyrilamine did not affect the response. Capsaicin treatment abolished the depressor response. These results suggest that spinal cord stimulation causes neurogenic vasodilation which is mediated by capsaicin-sensitive nonadrenergic and noncholinergic vasodilator nerves."
"We reported previously that following ileocystoplasty the structure and pharmacologic response of the implanted ileum changes towards that of the bladder. Specifically, the relaxation response to alpha adrenergic (methoxamine) and purinergic (ATP) stimulation reverses to a contractile response one month after the ileal segment is surgically made part of the urinary bladder. The present study was designed to investigate possible signals for this change and also to determine whether bladder responses would mimic the ileum if surgically interposed into the ileal stream. Rabbits in group 1 underwent bladder interposition into the functioning terminal ileum, rabbits in group 2 underwent tubularized ileocystoplasty and rabbits in group 3 underwent detubularized ileocystoplasty with urinary diversion. Twelve rabbits survived and were available for evaluation; five in group 1, three in group 2 and four in group 3. Analysis was done six weeks after surgery. In group 1 animals, the interposed bladder showed epithelial changes towards ileum and also a change in its in-vitro contractile responses towards that of ileum. In group 2 animals the tubular cystoplastic ileum showed minimal functional and morphologic changes. In group 3 animals, the defunctionalized, detubular cystoplastic ileum showed alpha adrenergic and purinergic response changes towards bladder. These results indicate that detubularization with interruption in the arrangement of smooth muscle fibers as well as the breach in the integrity of neuronal connections is likely to be the primary signal for the change in the ileum towards bladder induced by cystoplasty. The results can not rule out reinnervation of the intestinal segment by bladder nerves. In addition these data demonstrate that the pharmacologic response of the bladder changes towards the ileum within six weeks after the bladder is surgically made part of the ileum."
"This preliminary study has analyzed the potential ability of the 5-HT1A ligand spiroxatrine to interact with vascular alpha 1-adrenoceptors. Norepinephrine and the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, methoxamine, elicited concentration-dependent contractions of rat aortic rings. In contrast, (+/-)-spiroxatrine (from 10(-8) to 3.1X10(-7) M) was devoid of any effect on vascular tone per se, but shifted the concentration-response curves of norepinephrine and methoxamine to the right in a concentration-dependent manner with pA2 values of 8.48 +/- 0.22 and 8.93 +/- 0.33, respectively. Endothelium removal did not significantly affect the above pA2 values of (+/-)-spiroxatrine. These data, taken in concert, support the contention that (+/-)-spiroxatrine displays alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking properties in rat aortic rings."
"The contractile response of the bladder can be divided into two phases: an initial rapid increase in tension and a prolonged period of sustained tension (plateau phase). The bladder empties primarily during the plateau phase of the contractile response. These two phases can be differentiated using both pharmacologic and metabolic agents, indicating that the two phases have independent energy requirements. The present study compares the phasic (peak) and tonic (plateau) components of the responses of isolated strips of bladder body and base to field stimulation, bethanechol, methoxamine and KCl administration. New Zealand White rabbits were anesthetized with pentobarbital, and the bladder was removed. The bladder was divided between body and base at the level of the ureteral orifices. Three strips of bladder body and three strips of bladder base were mounted in separate baths containing Tyrode's solution at 37 degrees C and equilibrated with 95\% O2, 5\% CO2. Anoxia was produced by changing the gas mixture to 95\% nitrogen, 5\% CO2. The effects of anoxia on the responses to field stimulation, bethanechol, methoxamine and KCl were determined at different times after the initiation of anoxia. The results of these studies can be summarized as follows: (1) Anoxia induced time-dependent plateau phases of the response to field stimulation (2 and 32 Hz). (2) The rate of inhibition of the plateau phase was significantly and substantially greater than that of the peak phase in both the bladder body and base. (3) Similarly, anoxia inhibited the plateau phase of the bladder body's response to bethanechol to a significantly and substantially greater degree than anoxia inhibited the peak contraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Uninhibited bladder contractions have been associated with a variety of bladder dysfunctions including outlet obstruction, neurogenic bladder, incontinence, and other neurologic and nonneurogenic bladder disorders. One class of compounds that is gaining popularity and support for the treatment of hyperreflexia is potassium channel openers, such as pinacidil and cromakalim. In general, these agents act by hyperpolarizing the smooth muscle membrane, resulting in an increase in membrane stability which in turn would be expected to inhibit spontaneous and evoked contraction. It is the purpose of this study to compare the potency and selectivity of pinacidil at inhibiting both hyperreflexia in vivo, and several forms of in vitro contractile stimulation in the rabbit. The following is a summary of the results. (1) Pinacidil is an effective inhibitor of hyperreflexia in the in vivo rabbit model. (2) Pinacidil is a substantially more potent inhibitor of the amplitude of the hyperreflexia than the frequency. (3) Pinacidil was substantially more potent at inhibiting the contractile response to 2-Hz stimulation than to 32-Hz stimulation, but was equally effective at inhibiting field stimulation of the bladder base and body. (4) Pinacidil was significantly more potent at inhibiting the peak response to field stimulation than the rate of tension generation. (5) Pinacidil was equally potent and effective at inhibiting the phasic and tonic components of the response to field stimulation. (6) Pinacidil was a more potent inhibitor of methoxamine stimulation of the bladder base than bethanechol stimulation of the bladder body. (7) Pinacidil was a noncompetitive or mixed inhibitor of both methoxamine and bethanechol stimulation, whereas it was a competitive inhibitor of KCl stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"1. We determined if Ca2+ is a second messenger for adrenergic receptor-effector coupling in bovine corneal epithelial cells. 2. Methoxamine (10(-5) M) selectively increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration (Cai) by 65\%. This increase was only partially suppressed through the removal of extracellular Ca2+ or pretreatment with 10(-6) M verapamil. 3. The beta-adrenergic-mediated increases in Cai were entirely dependent on extracellular Ca2+. These increases were directly elicited through stimulation of adenylate cyclase because 10(-6) M isoproterenol and the active analogues of forskolin (10(-5) M) all elevated Cai. 4. Therefore, increases in Cai serve a second messenger function for alpha-1 and beta-adrenergic receptor-effector coupling."
"1. The pharmacological properties of presynaptic alpha 2-autoreceptors were studied in rat isolated submaxillary glands and atria. Tissue pieces were preincubated with [3H]-noradrenaline, then superfused with medium containing desipramine, and stimulated electrically. In one series of experiments, pEC30 values of 12 alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists were determined, i.e., negative logarithms of concentrations that increased the electrically evoked overflow of tritium by 30\%. In another series, pKD values of 9 alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists against the release-inhibiting effect of 5-bromo-6-(2-imidazolin-2-ylamino)-quinoxaline (UK 14304), and of 3 antagonists against the release-inhibiting effect of methoxamine, were determined. 2. In submaxillary glands, the pEC30 values of the antagonists correlated well with their pKD values against UK 14304 (r = 0.93). The same was true for atria (r = 0.92). 3. In submaxillary glands, the pKD values of 3 antagonists against UK14304 were very similar to their pKD values against methoxamine, with a maximal difference of 0.4. The same was true for atria where the maximal difference was 0.3. 4. The pEC30 values obtained in submaxillary glands correlated significantly with those obtained in atria (r = 0.81). The same was true for the pKD values (r = 0.79). However, the pEC30 and pKD values also indicated consistent differences between the two tissues. 5. It is concluded that the sites of action of the imidazoline UK 14304 (alpha 2-selective), the phenylethylamine noradrenaline, and the phenylethylamine methoxamine (alpha 1-selective) are exclusively alpha 2-adrenoceptors. There is no indication for presynaptic alpha 1-adrenoceptors or for an effect of UK 14304 mediated by presynaptic imidazoline receptors.The 02-autoreceptor population in the submaxillary gland differs from that in the atrium.6. Comparison with studies from the literature indicates that the submaxillary autoreceptors are closely similar to the a2D radioligand binding site found in the bovine pineal gland and probably the rat submaxillary gland. The atrial autoreceptors also conform best to this site, but the agreement is more limited; the atrial autoreceptors may represent a type related to, but distinct from, the a2D site, or a mixture of different types."
"Cardiovascular hypertrophy plays an important role in the development and maintenance of hypertension. Hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system may be one of the initiating factors responsible for the stimulation of growth processes involved in these structural alterations. We have used a well-established early biochemical marker of cellular growth processes, induction of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), to determine whether alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-induced vascular trophic responses are dependent on arterial pressure elevation. Hydralazine or felodipine were coadministered to control the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor agonist-induced rise in mean arterial pressure (MAP). Methoxamine (2, 5, or 10 mg/kg s.c.) increased the average MAP (up to 20 mm Hg) and vascular ODC activity (up to ninefold) above control rats over 4 hours. Concomitant administration of hydralazine (0.5, 1.25, or 5 mg/kg s.c.) or felodipine (100 or 250 micrograms/kg s.c.) with methoxamine (10 mg/kg) attenuated the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-induced activation of ODC in the aorta and mesenteric resistance vasculature, as well as the MAP increases. Vasodilators alone did not lower basal vascular ODC activity. The major findings include: 1) alpha 1-adrenergic receptor activation dose-dependently induces vascular ODC activity concomitantly with MAP elevation, 2) vasodilators inhibited both the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-induced MAP increases and the activation of mesenteric vascular and aortic ODC, and 3) the stimulus-response correlation between MAP elevation and mesenteric (r = 0.78) and aortic (r = 0.92) ODC activation was characterized by a logistic function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Application of 1 microM N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) either immediately before or following tetanic stimulation inhibits the induction of CA1 hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). We have examined the effect of trans-amino-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (ACPD), norepinephrine and acetylcholine on this NMDA-mediated LTP inhibition using extracellular recordings from in vitro rat hippocampal slices. When NMDA is accompanied by 100 microM ACPD or 10 microM norepinephrine, the block of LTP is overcome. The norepinephrine effect is mimicked by phenylephrine and methoxamine and is blocked by phentolamine and prazosin suggesting the involvement of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors."
"The selective alpha 1-adrenergic agonist methoxamine (10(-4)-10(-3) M), in the presence of propranolol (10(-6) M), can reduce both the inwardly rectifying K+ background current (IK1) and the muscarinic cholinergic receptor-activated K+ current (IK,ACh) in rabbit atrial myocytes resulting in action potential prolongation during the final phase of repolarization and a depolarization of the resting membrane potential. The reduction of these K+ currents(s) by alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation was insensitive to pre-treatment of atrial myocytes with pertussis toxin (0.15-0.5 micrograms/ml) and was irreversible following intracellular dialysis with the non-hydrolysable guanosine triphosphate (GTP) analogue, Gpp(NH)p (1-5 x 10(-3) M). Neither the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, 1((5-isoquinolinesulphonyl)-2-methylpiperoxine (H-7) (5 x 10(-5) M) and staurosporine (1 x 10(-7) M), nor "downregulation" of PKC by prolonged phorbol ester exposure (5 x 10(-7) M, for 7-8 h) had an effect on the alpha 1-adrenergic modulation of this K+ current. Under cell-attached patch-clamp conditions, bath application of methoxamine reversibly decreased acetylcholine-induced single-channel activity, thus confirming the observed reduction of the ACh-induced current under whole-cell voltage clamp. These results demonstrate that the alpha 1-adrenoceptor, once activated, can reduce current through two different inwardly rectifying K+ channels in rabbit atrial myocytes. These current changes are mediated via a pertussis toxin-insensitive GTP-binding protein, and do not appear to involve the activation of PKC."
"A possible contribution of adenine nucleotides to the endogenous purinergic, A1-receptor-mediated inhibition of noradrenaline release was studied in rabbit occipito-parietal cortex slices. The slices were preincubated with [3H]-noradrenaline and then superfused and stimulated electrically, in most experiments by trains of 6 pulses/100 Hz. A few experiments were carried out in rat occipito-parietal cortex slices. The A1-purinoceptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX; 1-100 nmol/l) as well as the enzyme adenosine deaminase (0.1-10 U/ml) increased the electrically evoked overflow of tritiated compounds. The maximal increase was by about 85\% for both DPCPX and adenosine deaminase. The increases obtained with maximally effective concentrations of DPCPX and adenosine deaminase were not additive. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor-selective agonist methoxamine (10 but not 1 mumol/l) reduced the evoked overflow. Its effect was antagonized by yohimbine 1 mumol/l but then not attenuated further by DPCPX 100 nmol/l. L-Glutamate (300 mumol/l-2.3 mmol/l) also reduced the evoked overflow of tritium. Its effect was not changed by yohimbine 1 mumol/l but greatly, and to the same extent, attenuated by DPCPX 100 nmol/l and adenosine deaminase 3 U/ml. Neither the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist dizocilpine nor omission of Mg++ changed the inhibition by glutamate. Glutamate did not alter the basal efflux of tritium from rabbit cortex slices under any experimental condition. In contrast, glutamate (100 mumol/l and 1 mmol/l) caused an immediate, marked and transient acceleration of tritium outflow from rat occipitoparietal cortex slices (medium without Mg++).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"The intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of clonidine, xylazine, adrenaline and methoxamine elicited dose-dependent vomiting in cats in that order of potency. The vomiting induced by clonidine, xylazine and adrenaline was antagonized by i.c.v. yohimbine and phentolamine possessing alpha 2-adrenoceptor-blocking activity, but not by prazosin showing alpha 1-adrenoceptor-blocking activity. In contrast, methoxamine-induced vomiting was antagonized by prazosin, but not by yohimbine. The vomiting induced by xylazine and adrenaline was not prevented by i.c.v. 6-hydroxydopamine treatment, but was prevented by i.c.v. reserpine treatment. Ablation of the area postrema with some damage to extremely adjacent areas abolished the vomiting induced by each alpha-adrenoceptor agonist. These results indicate that both central alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors are involved in the emetic pathway in cats, although alpha 2-adrenoceptors seem to have the main role. It is also suggested that monoamines, and in particular 5-hydroxytryptamine in the brain, are involved in the regulation of alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated vomiting."
"Endogenous inhibitor of protein kinases (type II inhibitor, GABA-modulin) blocks the phosphorylation catalyzed by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) as a competitive inhibitor of substrate proteins when histone is used as a substrate. Moreover, type II inhibitor blocks the phosphorylation of endogenous membrane proteins by PKC. Stimulation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors induced rapid redistribution of PKC from cytosol to membrane fraction which lasted at least 3 h, accompanied by rapid and short-lasting translocation of type II inhibitor from membrane to cytosol fraction. The cytosol content of type II inhibitor reached maximal level 10 and 20 min and became normal again 40 min after i.p. administration of methoxamine. The above actions of methoxamine were completely blocked by pretreatment with prazosin. It seems that short-lasting redistribution of type II inhibitor from membrane to cytosol fraction allows the effective phosphorylation of membrane proteins by PKC after stimulation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors."
"The role of central nor-epinephrine (NE) in electroacupuncture (EA) analgesia is a controversial question., it is probably due to the complication of adrenergic receptors. The present results show: (1) Clonidine 30 micrograms/2ml/kg ip had no significant effect on the pain threshold, but decreased the analgesic effect of EA. Clonidine 1.5 and 3 micrograms were injected into the lateral cerebral ventricles. After 45 minutes, the analgesic effect of EA was lowered as compared with the saline controls respectively. (2) Yohimbine had no significant effect on the basal pain threshold, but (icv Yoh 50 micrograms) elevated the analgesic effect of EA. (3) 2-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine decreased the analgesic effect of EA. (4) Another 2-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (icv 16 micrograms) enhanced the analgesic effect of EA. These results suggest that an activation of alpha 1- or alpha 2-adrenoceptors would decrease the analgesic effect of EA."
"The effects of somatostatin and alpha 1-adrenergic receptor agonists on cytosolic Ca2+ in striatal astrocytes from the embryonic mouse in primary culture have been investigated by microfluorimetry. Methoxamine or somatostatin induced a transitory increase in cytosolic Ca2+, but their combined addition led to a sustained increase in cytosolic Ca2+ which seems to be due to a Ca2+ influx since it was not observed in the absence of external Ca2+. Voltage-independent Ca2+ channels contribute to this process. Indeed, voltage-operated calcium channels are not involved since neither dihydropyridines nor La3+ were effective in suppressing the sustained cytosolic Ca2+ elevation. Moreover, depolarization by 50 mM KCl, which was ineffective alone, suppressed the effect of somatostatin observed in the presence of the alpha 1 agonist, methoxamine. The implication of arachidonic acid in the observed potentiation is suggested by the following observations: 1) arachidonic acid induced a sustained elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ similar to that evoked by the co-application of methoxamine and somatostatin; 2) the addition of ETYA, an inactive and non-metabolizable analogue of arachidonic acid suppressed the calcium plateau produced by the agonists. In addition, direct activation of PKC by an exogeneous diacylglycerol analogue allowed somatostatin alone to evoke a sustained elevation of cytosolic Ca2+. Therefore, methoxamine through the successive activation of PLC and PKC could allow a lipase, probably PLA2, to be stimulated by somatostatin. Since arachidonic acid has already been shown to trigger the opening of K+ channels and the formation of inositol phosphates, somatostatin, through the arachidonic acid-mediated hyperpolarization could increase the Ca2+ driving force and thus improve Ca2+ influx through the inositol phosphate gated channels."
"The authors investigated the effects of alterations in heart rate, contractility, and loading conditions on a newly defined systolic time interval, the Q-V peak, in 46 anesthetized dogs. The Q-V peak was measured as the time from the beginning of the electrocardiographic Q wave to the moment at which the blood flow rate reached its peak in the ascending aorta as determined with an electromagnetic flowmeter. The Q-V peak did not change significantly as the heart rate was varied by atrial pacing between 70 and 110 beats/minute. The Q-V peak shortened when the contractility was augmented with dobutamine (p = 0.0001) and was prolonged when it was depressed with propranolol (p = 0.0001). However, the Q-V peak did not change significantly when the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure or the mean aortic blood pressure was increased to 130\% or decreased to 70\% of the baseline values. These findings suggest that one may also evaluate left ventricular performance by measuring the time to systole, which the authors define as the Q-V peak."
"This study examined whether an increased activity of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor, nitric oxide, may account for the hyporesponsiveness to vasoconstrictors in portal hypertension. We performed dose-response curves to methoxamine, an alpha-adrenoceptor agonist, with and without N omega-nitro-L-arginine, a specific inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis, in experimental portal hypertension. Partial portal vein-ligated or sham-operated rats were pretreated with a continuous intravenous infusion of either N omega-nitro-L-arginine (50 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) or saline. Thirty minutes after starting the infusion of N omega-nitro-L-arginine or saline an infusion of methoxamine (10, 30 and 100 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) was added. Total peripheral resistance was calculated from mean arterial pressure and cardiac index. Repeated measurements of cardiac index were performed by a thermodilution technique. In portal vein-ligated rats pretreated with saline, the increase in total peripheral resistance after methoxamine infusion was significantly less than that of sham-operated rats (0.2 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.0 +/- 0.3, 0.6 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.3 and 3.7 +/- 0.5 vs. 6.1 +/- 0.7 mm Hg.ml-1.min.100 gm, p less than 0.05, methoxamine 10, 30 and 100 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, respectively). In the presence of N omega-nitro-L-arginine, the change in total peripheral resistance after methoxamine infusion was similar in both groups (p greater than 0.05). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that a vascular hyporesponsiveness to methoxamine is present in portal vein-ligated rats and that this hyporesponsiveness is reversed by blockade of nitric oxide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"1. The nature of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors which amplify the vasoconstrictor effect of methoxamine was examined in the rabbit isolated perfused ear artery with intact endothelium. Indices of amplification were leftward shifts of methoxamine dose-response (DR) curves produced by 5-HT (0.3 microM) (Method I), and the appearance of vasoconstrictor responses to 5-HT receptor agonists when methoxamine was present in a near-threshold concentration (Method II). 2. The amplifying effect of 5-HT (Method I) was unaffected by prazosin (0.08 microM), was partly depressed by 5-HT2-receptor antagonists in high concentrations (ketanserin 0.5 microM, LY53857, 1.0 microM), and was abolished by a non-selective antagonist of 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors (methiothepin, 0.01 microM). 3. Amplifying potencies of agonists assessed by both Methods I and II were in the order 5-carbox-amidotryptamine (5-CT) greater than 5-HT greater than alpha-methyl 5-HT. The potency of sumatriptan (assessed by Method II only) was intermediate between those of 5-HT and alpha-methyl 5-HT. 4. Ketanserin and LY53857 inhibited the amplifying action of 5-CT to about the same extent as that of 5-HT. 5. The amplifying potencies of the agonists are in marked contrast to the reported contractile potencies in the rabbit aorta where the receptor is 5-HT2, but are almost identical with reported contractile potencies in the dog saphenous vein where the receptor is 5-HT1-like. 6. It is concluded that a 5-HT,-like receptor mediates the amplifying interaction between 5-HT and methoxamine in the rabbit ear artery which can be weakly blocked by ketanserin and LY53857.7. Since 5-CT was equipotent when applied separately to the intimal and adventitial surfaces of the artery, it is suggested that the 5-HT,-like receptors are distributed uniformly across the artery wall."
"The mechanism of a sialagogue-induced increase in ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and the expressions of proto-oncogenes in murine parotid gland were investigated by use of isoproterenol (IPR), carbachol (CC), and methoxamine (MTX). The results were as follows: (1) The three sialagogues had similar effects on the parotid in vivo (mouse parotid after a single injection of IPR) and/or in vitro (rat parotid explants cultured on siliconized lens paper floating on 199 medium containing IPR, CC, or MTX), the order of their effectiveness being IPR > CC > MTX. (2) Northern/dot and Western blot analyses revealed that the sialagogues elevated the steady-state levels of ODC mRNA and ODC protein to maxima at two h and six h, respectively, after stimulation. The increases were roughly proportional to those in ODC activity, suggesting that sialagogue-dependent enzyme induction is regulated at the transcriptional level. (3) The mRNAs of four of nine proto-oncogenes examined showed sialagogue-dependent increases to maxima at 30 min (c-fos) or 60 min (c-jun, c-myc, and c-src) after the beginning of stimulation. These increases were all transient, with the levels returning to the control values (without sialagogue) within 60 min. (4) The IPR-dependent elevations of ODC activity and the mRNAs of ODC, c-fos, and c-jun were inhibited by monensin, but not by polymyxin B. On the other hand, the CC-dependent increases in these parameters were inhibited by polymyxin B but not by monensin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"1. Using a small vessel myograph, experiments were performed on rat small mesenteric arteries (and in some cases dog small coronary arteries) to assess the dependence of vasoconstrictor potency (EC50) and maximum response (Emax) on the initial passive conditions and on the mode of recording (i.e. isometric, isobaric or isotonic). 2. Maximum active isometric tension development to methoxamine occurred at different points on the passive diameter--tension curve depending on the origin of the vessel. The point of maximum sensitivity of methoxamine did not coincide with the point of maximum tension development on the passive diameter-tension curve. 3. Vascular reactivity to methoxamine was assessed under isobaric, isotonic and isometric conditions using a new computerized myograph. Methoxamine was significantly more potent, but only by a factor of twofold, when assessed under isometric conditions. In addition, the maximum response to methoxamine, in terms of diameter change, was always greater under isobaric than under isotonic conditions. 4. The results show that, in studies comparing vascular reactivity of vasoactive drugs, the results depend, to some extent, on the initial passive conditions selected. In terms of assessing the pharmacological activity of drugs on isolated blood vessels, the use of common isometric recording procedures are adequate. However, the use of isobaric, isotonic and isometric recording procedures have shown the complexities of vascular reactivity which depend on the passive and active properties of the blood vessel. These factors may need to be taken into account when comparing the reactivity of isolated blood vessels."
"Noradrenaline is involved in the regulation of the sleep/waking cycle by acting through various receptor types. In previous studies we investigated the role of beta- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors through local microinjections of various drugs into the dorsal pontine tegmentum (DPT) of the cat. This region is known to be crucially involved in desynchronized sleep execution. In this study we examined the role of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. The alpha 1-agonist methoxamine and the alpha 1-antagonist prazosin were injected into the DPT of freely moving, unanaesthetized cats. We found that methoxamine notably reduced desynchronized sleep, and that this effect was both dose-dependent and site-specific. These effects were prevented by the subsequent injection of prazosin. On the other hand, the injection into the DPT of prazosin alone produced scarce or inconsistent effects on the sleep/waking cycle."
"1. The effects of chronic administration of antihypertensive drugs on the vasodilator response mediated by calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-containing nerves were investigated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 2. A 7 week period of antihypertensive treatment with captopril, nicardipine or propranolol during the developmental phase (8-15 weeks of age) significantly lowered the mean blood pressure of SHR when compared with non-treated SHR. 3. The mesenteric vascular beds isolated from SHR, which were chronically administered with captopril, propranolol or nicardipine, were perfused with Krebs' solution containing 7 mumol/L methoxamine to produce active tone and 5 mumol/L guanethidine to block adrenergic neurotransmission. 4. In the mesenteric vascular bed with active tone, perivascular nerve stimulation (PNS; 0.5-8 Hz) caused a frequency-dependent vasodilator response that was abolished by 100 nmol/L tetrodotoxin (neurotoxin) or 1 mumol/L CGRP (8-37), a CGRP receptor antagonist. 5. CGRP-containing nerve-mediated vasodilator responses were significantly greater in captopril-treated SHR and significantly smaller in nicardipine-treated SHR than in non-treated SHR. There was no difference between the response between propranolol-treated SHR and non-treated SHR. 6. These results suggest that chronic treatment with captopril reverses the reduced neurogenic vasodilation mediated by CGRP-containing nerves in SHR."
"The vascular (blood pressure, heart rate and peripheral blood flow) and uterine (spontaneous motility) responses to intravenous methoxamine were studied in anaesthetized rats pre-treated with diethylstilboestrol. Methoxamine produced an increase (0.5-2 mg/kg) or did not modify (0.01 and 3 mg/kg) spontaneous uterine motility. The alpha 1-agonist also induced a hypertensive effect (0.1-3 mg/kg) accompanied by bradycardia at the highest doses, and a decrease in blood flow significantly greater in intestinal than uterine tissues. These effects were abolished by prazosin. The uterine action of methoxamine in vivo appears to result from the balance between myometrial alpha 1-excitatory effect and vascular alpha 1-vasoconstriction which induced uterine inhibition. The oestrogens appear to protect the alpha 1-mediated vasoconstriction."
"The goal of the present study was to examine baroreflex control of heart rate during pregnancy in chronically instrumented unrestrained rats. The same rats (n = 6) were studied before conception, again on gestational days 5, 12, and 19, and last on postpartum day 6; thus each rat served as its own control. Time control experiments were also conducted in a separate group of virgin rats (n = 7). Resting mean arterial pressure decreased by 10 mmHg on gestational day 19 (P less than 0.01 vs. prepregnant), and heart rate significantly increased by approximately 10\% relative to time control rats. Dose-response curves were constructed for methoxamine and sodium nitroprusside comparing the various dosages with systemic pressor and depressor responses, respectively. The dose-response relationship for methoxamine was shifted to the right in gravid rats of 19 gestational days (P less than 0.03 vs. prepregnant), indicating an attenuation of alpha-adrenergic receptor-mediated pressor responsiveness. In contrast, depressor responses to sodium nitroprusside were not significantly altered in pregnancy. Baroreflex-mediated bradycardia was unchanged until gestational day 19, when enhanced bradycardia responses to methoxamine were observed. Baroreflex-mediated tachycardic responses elicited by sodium nitroprusside were not affected at any stage of pregnancy. Baroreflex control of heart rate did not change significantly with either increases or decreases of blood pressure in time control experiments. We conclude that during late pregnancy in conscious rats 1) resting blood pressure decreases and heart rate increases, 2) systemic pressor responses to methoxamine are diminished, and 3) baroreflex-mediated bradycardia is enhanced."
"Bronchial hyperresponsiveness to cholinergic stimuli such as the inhalation of methacholine is common in patients with impaired left ventricular function. Such hyperresponsiveness is best explained by cholinergic vasodilation of blood vessels in the small airways, with extravasation of plasma due to high left ventricular filling pressure. Because this vasodilation may be prevented by the inhalation of the vasoconstrictor agent methoxamine, we studied the effect of methoxamine on exercise performance in patients with chronic left ventricular dysfunction.
We studied 19 patients with a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 22 +/- 4 percent and moderate exertional dyspnea. In the first part of the study, we performed treadmill exercise tests in 10 patients (group 1) at a constant maximal workload to assess the effects of 10 mg of inhaled methoxamine on the duration of exercise (a measure of endurance). In the second part of the study, we used a graded exercise protocol in nine additional patients (group 2) to assess the effects of inhaled methoxamine on maximal exercise capacity and oxygen consumption. Both studies were carried out after the patients inhaled methoxamine or placebo given according to a randomized, double-blind, crossover design.
In group 1, the mean (+/- SD) duration of exercise increased from 293 +/- 136 seconds after the inhalation of placebo to 612 +/- 257 seconds after the inhalation of methoxamine (P = 0.001). In group 2, exercise time (a measure of maximal exercise capacity) increased from 526 +/- 236 seconds after placebo administration to 578 +/- 255 seconds after methoxamine (P = 0.006), and peak oxygen consumption increased from 18.5 +/- 6.0 to 20.0 +/- 6.0 ml per minute per kilogram of body weight (P = 0.03).
The inhalation of methoxamine enhanced exercise performance in patients with chronic left ventricular dysfunction. However, the improvement in the duration of exercise at a constant workload (endurance) was much more than the improvement in maximal exercise capacity assessed with a progressive workload. These data suggest that exercise-induced vasodilation of airway vessels may contribute to exertional dyspnea in such patients. Whether or not inhaled methoxamine can provide long-term benefit in patients with heart failure will require further study."
"We have examined the effect of prophylactic treatment with i.v. fluid 1000 ml, ephedrine 24 mg or methoxamine 4 mg on cardiovascular responses to both extradural and combined extradural and general isoflurane anaesthesia in 45 adult patients undergoing knee arthroplasty. Heart rate (HR) and systemic arterial pressure (AP) were measured using automated oscillotonometry and cardiac output was measured using continuous wave suprasternal Doppler ultrasonography. After lumbar extradural anaesthesia (LEA) there were no significant differences in arterial pressure between treatments, although cardiac index was significantly greater after fluid preloading (mean 4.3 (95\% confidence interval 3.7-4.9) litre min-1 m-2) than after ephedrine (3.1 (2.6-3.6) litre min-1 m-2) or methoxamine (2.6 (2.0-3.2) litre min-1 m-2). During combined LEA and general anaesthesia, systolic AP was significantly greater after ephedrine (114 (103-125) mm Hg) than after either preloading (98 (88-107) mm Hg) or methoxamine (97 (89-105) mm Hg). The reduction in AP after induction of general anaesthesia was associated with a decrease in cardiac index after fluid preloading and a decrease in vascular resistance after methoxamine."
"It has previously been suggested that endogenous opioid peptides may suppress the pituitary-adrenal axis in man by inhibiting an excitatory alpha 1-adrenoceptor input to neural mechanisms liberating corticotrophin-releasing factor or factors (CRFs). This hypothesis has been tested here by investigating the effect of the met-enkephalin analog, DAMME (FK-33,824), on the elevation in serum cortisol induced by the catecholamine-releasing agent d-amphetamine (10 and 25 mg p.o.) and the direct alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine (6 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) in two groups of 6 normal male subjects. In both studies, the rise in serum cortisol was significantly attenuated by the analog of met-enkephalin. These data suggest that exogenous opioids act as a site downstream to the alpha 1-adrenoceptor input to CRF release; it appears that opioids modulate adrenocorticotrophic hormone release in man at a minimum of two distinct and separate sites."
"Treatment of rat parotid slices with carbachol (CCh) resulted in the stable inhibition of isoproterenol-induced activation of adenylate cyclase (AC); the inhibition of the enzyme was persistently observed in washed membrane prepared from parotid slices pretreated with CCh. Methoxamine, but not clonidine, also caused stable inhibition. Activation of AC by 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate (GppNHp) and by NaF was also attenuated by treatment with either CCh or methoxamine, indicating reduction of the Gs protein function. Pertussis toxin treatment prevented CCh-induced inhibition of the enzyme. However, MnCl2-stimulated and forskolin-stimulated activity, and the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated activity by GppNHp were not altered by CCh treatment. It appears, therefore, that the stable muscarinic inhibition of AC involves the Gi protein, but it does not result from the inhibitory regulation of AC activity by the interaction between the Gi protein and the catalytic unit of AC. Furthermore, the inhibition of GppNHp-stimulated AC activity by CCh was effectively reversed by the pretreatment of slices with neomycin. This suggests that the stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis elicited by CCh possibly participates in stable muscarinic inhibition of AC presumably by reducing the function of the Gs protein. Thus, in the rat parotid gland, CCh appears to cause a stable inhibition of AC through two different mechanisms; one is associated with the Gi protein and the other is associated with the stimulation of phosphoinositide metabolism."
"The excitatory effects of adrenoceptor agonists on ventral horn cells were compared using an extracellular recording technique in spinal cord slices isolated from non-treated and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-treated rats (intracisternally 14 days previously). In spinal cord slices isolated from 6-OHDA-treated rats, the concentration-response curves for the alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated facilitatory effects produced by noradrenaline and phenylephrine but not those produced by methoxamine and isoproterenol were shifted to the left. 6-OHDA pretreatment decreased the level and uptake of noradrenaline and increased the number of [3H]prazosin binding sites in the spinal cord. These results suggest that in 6-OHDA-induced denervation, functional supersensitivity of the alpha 1-adrenergic system in the spinal ventral horn is due to absence of an uptake system, and not to postsynaptic change."
"The effect of alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation on the concentration of cytosolic free calcium (Cai2+) was determined by measuring indo-l fluorescence in isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes from normal and streptozotocin-diabetic rat; 1.3 x 10(5) alpha 1-adrenoceptors per normal myocyte and an unaltered number of these receptors in cells from diabetic rats were detected using the alpha 1-selective ligand WB-4101. Under basal conditions, Cai2+ was found to be 154 +/- 4 nM (n = 34) reaching a value of 192 +/- 10 nM (n = 15) after stimulation of myocytes with a maximal dose of methoxamine for 5 min. Under the same conditions the leakage of dye produced a significantly smaller increase of basal values of 169 +/- 5 nM (n = 17). Indo-l loaded cells did not respond to beta-stimulation unless in the presence of KCl (50 mM), demonstrating the specificity of methoxamine action. Treatment of cells with nifedipine or chelation of extracellular calcium by EGTA did not modify the alpha-adrenergic response. Experiments with cardiomyocytes from streptozotocin-diabetic rats showed an unaltered modulation of Cai2+ by both alpha- and beta-receptor stimulation. It is concluded that signalling by alpha 1-adrenoceptors in ventricular cardiomyocytes results in mobilization of intracellular calcium stores."
"The effect of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in neurotransmission of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-containing vasodilator nerves was investigated in rats. In perfused mesenteric vascular beds with active tone, perivascular nerve stimulation (PNS; 1-8 Hz) caused a frequency-dependent vasodilator response, which was abolished by 300 nM tetrodotoxin (TTX), 500 nM capsaicin, 1 microM human CGRP-(8-37), or cold storage denervation (4 degrees C for 72 h). NPY (5, 10, and 50 nM) concentration dependently inhibited the vasodilator response to PNS, whereas NPY had little effect on vasodilation induced by exogenous CGRP (10 and 100 pmol) or 1 nmol acetylcholine (ACh). NPY (10 nM) inhibited the neurogenic release of CGRP-like immunoreactivity induced by PNS (4 and 8 Hz), which was abolished by 300 nM TTX and the removal of Ca2+ from the medium. Combined perfusion with 5 nM NPY and 10 nM norepinephrine additively inhibited the vasodilator response to PNS but not to exogenous CGRP and ACh. Immunohistochemistry showed the distinct distribution of CGRP- and NPY-like immunoreactivity-containing fibers in rat mesenteric arteries. These results suggest that NPY modulates presynaptically the release of CGRP from CGRP-containing vasodilator nerves in rat mesenteric arteries."
"The cardiovascular responses induced by intracerebroventricular or intravenous administration of ketanserin in normotensive rats were evaluated. Ketanserin, which is an antagonist at 5-HT2 receptors, when microinfused into the third cerebral ventricle, did not induce significant cardiovascular effects, except for a slight and transitory hypotensive response after the microinfusion of the highest dose (200 micrograms). However, at doses which were unable to affect directly blood pressure or heart rate, ketanserin, microinfused into the same site, antagonized the pressor response induced by peripheral administration of methoxamine, an alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist. Furthermore, peripheral administration of ketanserin produced dose-dependent hypotension and bradycardia and antagonized the pressor effect of an intravenous bolus injection of methoxamine. In conclusion, the present experiments confirmed the ability of ketanserin to produce cardiovascular effects when administered peripherally and provides evidence for an involvement of ketanserin-sensitive receptors in the brain in the regulation of phasic responses during experimentally induced hypertension."
"The role of alpha 2-adrenoceptors on vascular sympathetic nerve endings in modulating release of the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) in humans was examined by measuring the regional rate of appearance of NE in forearm venous plasma (forearm NE spillover [FSO]) in 32 healthy volunteers during intra-arterial infusion of drugs acting at adrenoceptors or directly on vascular smooth muscle. Simultaneous intra-arterial infusions of tracer amounts of [3H]NE were used to calculate the extraction rate of NE in the forearm. Methoxamine or propranolol with epinephrine (PRO + EPI) was used to stimulate alpha-adrenoceptors, yohimbine was used to inhibit alpha-adrenoceptors, and sodium nitroprusside (NIP) was used to produce increases in forearm blood flow directly. Sympathetic efferent activity was manipulated by systemic intravenous infusions of NIP or trimethaphan. Yohimbine and NIP increased and PRO + EPI and methoxamine decreased NE FSO, without effects on systemic blood pressure, heart rate, or arterial levels of catechols. Changes in FSO were flow dependent; therefore, the slope of the relation between the changes in FSO and forearm blood flow was used to evaluate the effects of each drug on regional sympathoneural activity. During administration of yohimbine, the mean slope of the relation between the change in estimated FSO and the change in forearm blood flow was about four times that of the mean slope during administration of NIP (F = 6.35, p less than 0.05). The slopes of the relations between changes in FSO and forearm blood flow were unaffected by systemic trimethaphan or NIP infusion, indicating that the activity of alpha 2-adrenoceptors was not altered during inhibition or reflexive stimulation of sympathetic outflow. The results suggest that alpha 2-adrenoceptors modulate release of NE from vascular sympathetic nerve endings in humans and that the function of these receptors is unchanged during acute changes in junctional NE concentrations."
"Epinephrine has been shown to impair pulmonary excretion of CO2 during resuscitation. This phenomenon was investigated in a rodent model of cardiac arrest and conventional resuscitation.
The effects of racemic epinephrine were compared with the selective alpha 1-agonist methoxamine and with saline placebo during cardiac resuscitation in 15 Sprague-Dawley rats mechanically ventilated with gas containing 70\% oxygen. Epinephrine and methoxamine but not saline placebo significantly increased coronary perfusion pressure from approximately 32 to 55 mm Hg. Following epinephrine, end-tidal PCO2 decreased from approximately 10 to 5 mm Hg. This was associated with a time-coincident decrease in PaO2 from approximately 130 to 74 mm Hg and an increase in PaCO2 from approximately 26 to 40 mm Hg. These changes indicated increases in alveolar dead space ventilation concomitant with increases in pulmonary arteriovenous admixture. No such effects were observed after administration of either methoxamine or saline placebo. Each of the 15 rats was successfully resuscitated. However, a significantly larger number of transthoracic countershocks were required after epinephrine compared with methoxamine or placebo before return of spontaneous circulation.
Epinephrine induced ventilation/perfusion during cardiopulmonary resuscitation as a result of redistribution of pulmonary blood flow."
"The onset of puberty in female rhesus monkeys is characterized by increases in pulsatile LHRH release. In this study we have tested the hypothesis that changes in input to the LHRH neurosecretory system from noradrenergic neurons contribute to this pubertal increase in LHRH release. In the first experiment, the ability of the LHRH neurosecretory system of prepubertal (12-20 months of age, no signs of puberty evident), early pubertal (24-30 months, premenarchial), and midpubertal (30-45 months, postmenarchial but prior to first ovulation) monkeys to respond to alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation was tested. LHRH release in the stalk-median eminence of conscious monkeys was measured using an in vivo push-pull perfusion method. During push-pull perfusion, perfusates were collected continuously in 10-min fractions, and the alpha 1-adrenergic stimulant methoxamine (MTX, 10(-8), 10(-5) M) or vehicle was infused through the push cannula for 10 min at 90 min intervals. LHRH levels in perfusates were estimated by RIA. Monkeys in all three age groups responded to MTX with significant increases in LHRH release, with the response of the prepubertal group being significantly greater than that of the older age groups. The results indicate that alpha 1-adrenergic receptors are present and functional prior to puberty. In the second experiment, norepinephrine (NE) release in perfusates collected from monkeys in the three age groups was measured by HPLC with electrochemical detection. NE release increased significantly from the pre- and early pubertal to the midpubertal stage. The enhanced sensitivity of prepubertal monkeys to MTX may be due to the absence of high levels of endogenous NE, which results in a situation similar to denervation hypersensitivity. During the early pubertal stage, increases in input from noradrenergic neurons to the LHRH neurosecretory system may occur, thereby resulting in increases in LHRH release, since early pubertal monkeys are highly sensitive to alpha-adrenergic input. Therefore, we propose that the increase in NE release during puberty contributes to the developmental increase in LHRH release."
"The existence of sigma receptors in the mouse, rat and guinea pig vasa deferentia has previously been proposed, although drug effects are inconsistent and generally occur only at high concentrations. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate lower, physiologically relevant concentrations of ligands for possible sigma effects on electrically stimulated twitch contractions in the mouse vas deferens (MVD). Putative sigma agonists and antagonists all inhibited 0.1 Hz electrically stimulated twitch contractions in nM concentrations. Inhibitory activity plateaued between 20 and 60\% for all compounds except 1,3-di(2-tolyl)guanidine (DTG), which had a shallow concentration-effect curve. Subsequent to the plateau, higher concentrations (30 microM) of rimcazole and haloperidol fully inhibited electrically stimulated twitch contractions. There was no correlation between inhibitory potency or maximal effect in the MVD and binding potency at sigma sites in either MVD or guinea pig brain. The inhibitory effects of R(+)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-1-propylpiperidine ((+)3-PPP) or DTG on electrically stimulated twitch contractions were not antagonized by the putative sigma antagonists DTG, haloperidol, rimcazole or BMY-14802, nor by alpha 2-adrenoceptor, dopamine D1, dopamine D2 or opiate antagonists. Although the mechanism of sigma ligand effects in the MVD has not been established, the data caution against a presumption that effects of sigma ligands on electrically stimulated twitch contractions in this preparation are mediated by sigma receptors."
"Sheep were exposed to a live- vaccine derived strain of Pasteurella haemolytica (10(5) colony forming units/sheep, i.m.) and euthanized 3 days later. Pulmonary artery and vein ex vivo responses to cumulative doses of methoxamine were determined. In some experiments endothelium was removed. In the pulmonary artery, removal of the endothelium significantly impairs the potency of methoxamine as a contractile agent in control sheep. Also, in sheep exposed to P. haemolytica removal of the endothelium ex vivo impairs the efficacy of methoxamine as a contractile agent. In the pulmonary vein, removal of the endothelium significantly increases the maximum contractile response obtained in control sheep. Conversly, in the pulmonary vein from P. haemolytica exposed sheep, removal of the endothelium reduces the efficacy of methoxamine. These experiments suggest that vaccination with live P. haemolytica impairs pulmonary vascular alpha adrenergic responses. Such impairments may contribute to development of pulmonary edema and congestion during stressful periods such as post-vaccination."
"We have proposed a three step model for the specification of left-right in mammalian embryos. The fundamental assumption is that handedness is imparted by an asymmetrical molecule. Conversion of molecular asymmetry to the cellular level gives a property to one side of the embryo to bias an otherwise random generation of an asymmetrical gradient which can be interpreted by developing organs. Rat embryos, treated at discrete stages, show a window of sensitivity for disruption of handedness, which may reflect the time of conversion/biasing. Heat shock and several chemicals cause left-right inversion in up to 50\% of embryos exposed during neural groove formation. Earlier stages are less sensitive; no treatment begun after foregut pocket formation influences asymmetry. Evidence for cellular interactions in left-right specification comes from the apparent rescue of iv/iv mutant embryos in chimeras. We are looking for molecular left-right disparity before morphological asymmetry but detect no differences in two-dimensional protein profiles. Using an indirect measure, we find a right-left gradient of tissue oxygen in embryos at the 20-30 somite stage. This may reflect asymmetrical vasculature, as we have suggested to explain drug-induced asymmetrical limb malformations."
"To determine if local release of norepinephrine within the medullary dorsal horn influences autonomic responses often associated with nociception, microinjections of norepinephrine or of specific adrenergic receptor agonists were directed at the trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc) in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. Norepinephrine (20 nmol, 100 nl) evoked a significant increase (+ 233.8 +/- 89.5 pg/ml, P less than 0.01) in plasma concentrations of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) after injections within the superficial laminae (I-II) of Vc, whereas mean arterial pressure or heart rate were not affected. Methoxamine (20 nmol), an alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, injections into laminae I-II also increased plasma ACTH (+ 90.6 +/- 32 pg/ml, P less than 0.025) without affecting arterial pressure or heart rate. Norepinephrine injections into the deeper laminae (III-V) of Vc caused a variable increase in plasma ACTH (+ 203.5 +/- 146.5 pg/ml, P less than 0.01) that was not mimicked by injections of methoxamine. Microinjections of alpha 2-(clonidine) or beta-(isoproterenol) adrenergic receptor agonists into Vc had no effect on plasma ACTH regardless of the laminar site of injection. The results suggest that norepinephrine acts within Vc to alter selected autonomic responses often associated with nociception. The involvement of an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtype within the superficial laminae of the medullary dorsal horn suggests a neural mechanism for norepinephrine-evoked increase in plasma ACTH that is distinct from the well known alpha 2-adrenergic receptor-mediated antinociceptive effects of norepinephrine."
"1. Ventricular myocytes were isolated by enzymatic dispersion of adult rabbit hearts, and voltage clamped using the whole-cell variation of the patch clamp technique. Experiments were carried out at either 35 degrees C or room temperature (21-23 degrees C). 2. In the presence of 10(-3) M-4-aminopyridine to block the transient outward K+ current, and 10(-6) M-propranolol to block beta-adrenoceptors, the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist methoxamine produced action potential prolongation, and a small depolarization of the diastolic membrane potential. Under voltage clamp conditions, methoxamine decreased the magnitude of the inward rectifier K+ current, IK1, in both the inward and outward directions. This effect was dose dependent (10(-5)-10(-3) M) and fully reversible upon wash-out of the agonist. 3. The neurotransmitter noradrenaline (10(-6)-2 x 10(-5) M), in the presence of propranolol (10(-6) M), also reduced IK1 in ventricular cells, and this effect was blocked by the specific alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. 4. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated decrease in IK1 in ventricular myocytes was not affected by pre-incubation of the cells with 0.5 micrograms/ml pertussis toxin (8-10 h, 30-32 degrees C). This result suggests that in rabbit ventricular cells, the alpha 1-modulation of IK1 occurs via a pertussis toxin-insensitive guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein. 5. These observations demonstrate that IK1 in ventricular myocytes can be modulated by cardiac alpha 1-adrenoceptors. The resulting changes in action potential repolarization and diastolic membrane potential may have significant effects on cardiac performance."
"Halothane effects on action potential characteristics and conduction were determined in canine Purkinje fibers, before and during alpha-adrenergic stimulation. Halothane significantly decreased effective refractory period and action potential duration in Purkinje fibers. alpha-Adrenergic stimulation restored effective refractory period and action potential duration in Purkinje fibers exposed to halothane via an alpha 1-adrenoceptor mediated effect antagonized by prazosin. Halothane significantly slowed propagation of impulses initiated at a basic cycle length of 500 ms, and conduction of premature impulses, in Purkinje fibers. In the presence of halothane, alpha-adrenergic stimulation had no additional effects on normal impulse propagation; however, alpha-adrenergic stimulation significantly slowed the conduction of premature impulses in Purkinje fibers exposed to halothane. These data refute a previous report that alpha-adrenergic stimulation enhances halothane's negative dromotropic effect in Purkinje fibers paced at a basic drive cycle length. alpha-Adrenergic prolongation of the conduction times of premature stimuli in Purkinje fibers exposed to halothane is a new finding."
"Intracellular Ca++ ([Ca++]i) is one of the most important second messengers of extracellular signals that induce cellular responses. In epidermal keratinocytes, both extracellular and intracellular Ca++ are reported to be important to cell differentiation and proliferation. Several mechanisms that increase [Ca++]i have been elicited in various tissues; however, in epidermal keratinocytes they remain unknown. Thus, we investigated the [Ca++]i modulation in cultured human epidermal keratinocytes and the stimulation that increases the concentration. The [Ca++]i concentration of keratinocytes was increased immediately and transiently by epinephrine. Methoxamine hydrochloride and clonidine (alpha-1- and 2-adrenergic agonists) did not induce an increase in [Ca++]i. The beta-antagonist, propranolol, inhibited the [Ca++]i increase induced by epinephrine and salbutamol (a beta-2-agonist). These results reveal that the beta-adrenergic stimulation induces an immediate and transient [Ca++]i increase in human keratinocytes. Beta-adrenergic stimulation is known to induce adenylate cyclase activation, which results in cyclic AMP accumulation through stimulatory guanosine 5-triphosphate (GTP) binding proteins in the keratinocytes. Also, epinephrine is reported to inhibit cultured epidermal cell proliferation. The effect of epinephrine has been demonstrated by cyclic AMP accumulation; however, beta-adrenergic stimulation revealed a [Ca++]i increase in keratinocytes in our study. One of epinephrine's regulatory effects on epidermal cell proliferation is assumed to occur through the [Ca++]i increase as well."
"The alpha-adrenoceptor populations in aortic strips from humans, rats, guinea-pigs and rabbits were investigated in vitro, using specific agonists and antagonists. In rabbit and human preparations the activities of the two agonists tested, noradrenaline and methoxamine, were competitively antagonized by prazosin, whereas in the other animal species prazosin showed a competitive antagonism for methoxamine induced contraction, but an uncompetitive behaviour against noradrenaline. The alpha 2-selective agonists B-HT 920 and detomidine did not elicit any effect on aortic strips up to 10(-3) M. On the basis of these results, alpha 1-receptors seem to represent an homogeneous population in human and rabbit aortae, but not in rat and guinea-pig tissues. On the other hand, the contractile response of noradrenaline and methoxamine on aortic strips from the four animal species examined cannot be ascribed to the activation of postsynaptic alpha 2-receptors. Moreover we present preliminary evidence that rat and guinea-pig aortae do not contain a clear subdivision in alpha 1a- and alpha 1b-receptors."
"1 The stimulating activity of methoxamine on rat vas deferens differed from that of noradrenaline since it induced a strong rhythmic activity which was not removed by the wash-out of the drug. 2 Clonidine showed a dose-response curve with a pD2 of 5.05 +/- 0.14 and an intrinsic activity value of 0.6 +/- 0.1\%; B-HT 920, a specific alpha 2-agonist, elicited a very low stimulating effect (pD2 = 2.87 +/- 0.04; i.a. = 0.08 +/- 0.001). 3 In a calcium-free medium the maximum responses to synthetic alpha-adrenoceptor agonists were reduced by 98 +/- 0.8\% compared with the control value. The residual response to noradrenaline, however, was significantly higher (15 +/- 0.9\% of the control value). 4 At high concentration of the Ca-channel antagonists, nicardipine and verapamil, only noradrenaline showed a residual response that was resistant to the calcium channel blockers. This residual response was completely inhibited by chloroethylclonidine (10(-5) M). 5 It is proposed that the stimulating activity of the physiological adrenergic agonist, noradrenaline, is more complex when compared to that of synthetic agonists and it might result from an interaction with different alpha-adrenoceptors. 6 Both salbutamol and forskolin were able to abolish the rhythmic activity of methoxamine, suggesting a regulatory role of cAMP on membrane stability."
"Phenylephrine increased [3H]norepinephrine efflux and accumulation of cyclic AMP in cultured rat superior cervical ganglion cells superfused with Tyrode's solution. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism and relationship between these two events. Electrical stimulation (1-2 Hz), potassium chloride (50 mM), and the preferential alpha 1-adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine (1-100 microM) increased fractional tritium efflux, whereas methoxamine, cirazoline, and amidephrine were relatively ineffective. Phenylephrine, but not methoxamine and cirazoline, also increased cyclic AMP accumulation. Phenylephrine-induced tritium efflux was not altered by alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists or by removal of extracellular calcium. Phenylephrine-induced cyclic AMP accumulation was blocked by the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists propranolol and atenolol. Forskolin (10 microM) and the nonhydrolyzable cyclic AMP analogue 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)cyclic AMP (100 microM) had minimal effect on tritium efflux. However, phenylephrine-evoked increase in tritium efflux was dose dependently attenuated by the neuronal uptake blocker cocaine, and phenylephrine dose-dependently inhibited the incorporation of [3H]norepinephrine into neuronal stores. We conclude that the increase in tritium efflux induced by phenylephrine is independent of cyclic AMP accumulation and appears to be mediated by uptake of phenylephrine via the neuronal carrier-mediated amine transport process, which in turn promotes efflux of the adrenergic transmitter from its storage sites."
"To confirm the consistent effects on Doppler-measured aortic blood flow velocity waveform variables of alterations in left ventricular preload, afterload, and inotropy using pharmacologic and physiologic maneuvers.
Medical school laboratory.
Healthy volunteers.
Increasing infusion rates of dobutamine (1.25 to 5 micrograms/kg.min), esmolol (1.25 to 5 mg/min), phentolamine (1.25 to 5 mg/min), methoxamine (1.25 to 5 mg/min), metaraminol (1.25 to 5 mg/min), and placebo (1.25 to 5 mL of 0.9\% saline/min) and increasing plasma removal (0.5 to 1 L) in awake, rested, supine subjects.
Ascending aortic blood flow was measured by the suprasternal Doppler approach allowing calculation of waveform variables of stroke distance and minute distance (linear measures of stroke volume and cardiac output), peak velocity, mean acceleration and flow time corrected for heart rate. An index of systemic vascular resistance was obtained by dividing mean systemic BP by the minute distance. Inotropic changes predominantly affected peak velocity and mean acceleration. Changes in preload mainly affected the flow time corrected for heart rate, whereas afterload changes had an intermediate effect. Unsuspected but subsequently confirmed hemodynamic effects were seen with esmolol and metaraminol.
Aortic blood flow velocity waveform variables measured by Doppler ultrasound can be used to noninvasively follow changes in left ventricular preload, afterload, and inotropy."
"The effect of alpha-adrenergic receptor activation on regional contractile function and transmural myocardial blood flow is controversial. Accordingly, the effects of selective alpha 1-(methoxamine) and alpha 2-(BHT 933) receptor stimulation on regional contractile function and transmural myocardial blood flow distribution were studied in 15 anesthetized open-chest dogs.
The alpha-adrenergic agonists were separately infused into the cannulated left circumflex coronary artery during control and ischemic conditions in the same animal. Mean coronary perfusion pressure was held constant by a servocontrolled pump in an extracorporeal circuit. Ischemia was created by reducing coronary perfusion pressure to the level at which percent systolic wall thickening (\%WT) decreased by 54\%. Contractile function during control conditions was unchanged, whereas under ischemic conditions a further significant decrease in \%WT of 27\% occurred with either alpha 1- or alpha 2-receptor stimulation without any change in the anterior (control) wall function. Both alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptor stimulations during control conditions resulted in a relatively uniform transmural decrease in blood flow with no change in the subendocardial-to-subepicardial blood flow ratio. With alpha 1-stimulation during ischemia (n = 13), there was a tendency toward decreased subepicardial blood flow with no change in subendocardial flow, resulting in an increased subendocardial-to-subepicardial blood flow ratio (0.61 +/- 0.23 to 0.82 +/- 0.40, p less than 0.05). alpha 2-Receptor stimulation during ischemia (n = 12) produced a significant decrease in subepicardial blood flow (0.45 +/- 0.20 to 0.35 +/- 0.12 ml/min/g, p less than 0.01) with no change in subendocardial blood flow, also resulting in an increased subendocardial-to-subepicardial blood flow ratio.
These results indicate the selective vasoconstriction in outer wall layers during ischemia mediated by either alpha 1- or alpha 2-receptors can cause a decrease in regional contractile function despite unchanged subendocardial blood flow and improved subendocardial-to-subepicardial flow ratio. This suggests an adverse effect of alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction during ischemia in this coronary perfusion pressure-controlled canine model."
"Ligand binding studies with WB 4101 revealed that the rat aorta contains both the alpha 1a- and alpha 1b-adrenoceptor subtypes. Results obtained following treatment with the irreversible antagonists phenoxybenzamine, chlorethylclonidine or SZL-49 (4-amino-6,7-dimethoxy-2-quinazolinyl-4-(2-bicyclo[2,2,2]octa-2,5- dienylcarbonyl-2-piperazine) suggest that there is a complex interaction between the alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes in the aorta. Chlorethylclonidine affects only the alpha 1b-adrenoceptor, whereas the predominant action of SZL-49 is on the alpha 1a-subtype. Chlorethylclonidine significantly inhibited the response to either methoxamine or phenylephrine, agents which are selective alpha 1a-adrenoceptor agonists. Following inactivation with either chlorethylclonidine or SZL-49, the response of the rat aorta to phenylephrine was only partially antagonized by either prazosin or WB 4101. SZL-49 also inhibited the response of the rat tail artery to electrical stimulation. The response of the tail artery obtained following inactivation with SZL-49 was effectively antagonized by prazosin. Phenylephrine, prazosin or WB 4101 afforded complete protection from chlorethylclonidine adrenoceptor inactivation, while these same ligands were only partially effective against SZL-49. Either SZL-49 or chlorethylclonidine significantly impaired the irreversible adrenoceptor blocking actions of phenoxybenzamine. These results suggest: (1) only the alpha 1a-adrenoceptor subtype appears to be associated with nerve terminals in the tail artery, (2) there may be a complex interaction between the alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes such that both receptors must be intact and functional to observe normal agonist and antagonist interactions, (3) there may be three sites of action for agonists associated with the rat aorta."
"As previously shown with adenosine, somatostatin, which is ineffective alone, enhanced the alpha 1-adrenergic-agonist-stimulated production of inositol phosphates in cultured striatal astrocytes. This effect was suppressed in cells pretreated with pertussis toxin. It required external calcium and was selectively antagonized by both mepacrine, an inhibitor of phospholipase A2, and 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid, a nonmetabolizable analog of arachidonic acid. In addition, a long-lasting elevation of cytosolic calcium and a release of arachidonic acid were observed only under the combined stimulation of somatostatin and alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. Arachidonic acid could in turn inhibit glutamate uptake into astrocytes, and the resulting external accumulation of glutamate could account for the somatostatin-evoked amplification of the alpha 1-adrenergic-agonist-stimulated hydrolysis of inositol-phospholipids. The effect of somatostatin was indeed reproduced by glutamate or glutamate uptake inhibitors and suppressed by enzymatic removal of external glutamate. Thus, astrocytes may contribute to long-term plasticity events in glutamatergic synapses through regulation of external glutamate levels."
"To investigate possible mechanisms for the differing electrophysiological actions of alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation in superfused myocardium and isolated, perfused hearts, we compared the cellular electrophysiological responses to methoxamine (10(-7), 10(-6) and 10(-5)M) in isolated, buffer-perfused guinea-pig hearts and superfused right ventricular tissue at 32 degrees C and 37 degrees C. During superfusion at 32 degrees C with 10(-7)M methoxamine, action potential duration increased. Similar increases in action potential duration and refractory period were seen with 10(-6) M methoxamine while with 10(-5)M methoxamine action potential duration increased but refractory period was unchanged. At 37 degrees C, no changes occurred with 10(-7)M and 10(-6)M methoxamine, but with 10(-5)M, action potential duration increased. Perfusion of isolated hearts with 10(-7)M and 10(-6)M methoxamine had no effect on action potential duration and refractory period at 32 degrees C, but with 10(-5)M methoxamine, refractory period increased. No changes occurred in the hearts at 37 degrees C. Methoxamine had no effect on maximum upstroke velocity of the action potential, conduction time, QRS width and pacing threshold in the perfused hearts or the superfused ventricular strips. Methoxamine (10(-6)M) also reduced action potential duration and refractory period in hearts made globally ischaemic, confirming previous results. Thus, methoxamine increases action potential duration and refractory period in superfused ventricular tissue (32 degrees C greater than 37 degrees C), has no effect in normally perfused hearts, but during myocardial ischaemia reduces action potential duration and refractory period."
"1. The biological activity of a plasma-derived, clonidine displacing substance (CDS)-like material was tested on isolated rat aortic rings and compared to that of clonidine, an imidazoline with alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist properties. 2. The CDS-like material was partially purified from expired human blood. This product inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the binding of [3H]-clonidine to rat brain membranes with a ki of 0.87 +/- 0.4 u ml-1, without affecting the binding of the alpha 1-antagonist, [3H]-WB4101. 3. When the CDS-like material (0.14-6 u ml-1) was applied to the bathing medium of isolated rat aortic rings, it caused dose-dependent contractions with an EC50 of 1.0 +/- 0.18 u ml-1. Clonidine also dose-dependently contracted rat aortic rings (EC50, 1.1 +/- 0.24 x 10(-7) M). The maximal tension developed in response to clonidine, however, was higher (1.37 +/- 0.15 g) compared to that developed in response to the CDS-like material (0.92 +/- 0.12 g). 4. Contractions induced by both CDS-like material and clonidine were antagonized by 5 x 10(-7) M rauwolscine, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist. Prazosin, an alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, at 10(-8) M, greatly reduced contractions caused by clonidine while leaving those caused by CDS-like material unaffected. 5. The CDS-like material failed to alter the tension of intact or endothelium-denuded rat aortic rings which had been precontracted with methoxamine. Clonidine on the other hand, caused dose-dependent relaxations in intact, though not in denuded, precontracted rat aortic rings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Several investigators have reported a diminished responsiveness of senescent cardiac muscle to norepinephrine and beta-adrenoceptor agonists. In contrast, relatively little is known regarding the effects of aging on myocardial actions mediated specifically by alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation. Thus, the current study examined aging-dependent changes in: (a) the inotropic response to methoxamine, an alpha-adrenoceptor agonist; (b) characteristics of myocardial alpha 1-adrenoceptors as monitored by specific [3H]prazosin binding; and (c) steady state levels of alpha 1-adrenoceptor mRNA as determined by Northern blot analysis. Cardiac preparations were isolated from 4-, 14-, and 25-month-old F344 rats. An aging-associated decline was observed in the maximum positive inotropic effect elicited by methoxamine in right ventricular strips (160 +/- 23, 134 +/- 13 and 79 +/- 26\% increase above control developed tension in 4, 14 and 25 months, respectively) with no change in ED50 values. [3H]Prazosin binding to ventricular sarcolemmal membranes revealed a reduction in receptor number (82 +/- 7, 69 +/- 6 and 59 +/- 5 fmol/mg protein in 4, 14 and 25 months, respectively); the apparent dissociation constant was not affected. Steady state levels of alpha 1-adrenoceptor mRNA decreased progressively between 4 and 25 months of age (14- and 25-month levels were approximately 71 and 38\% of 4 months, respectively), while steady state levels of beta-actin mRNA did not change with age. These results suggest that the aging-related decline in alpha 1-adrenergic responsiveness in rat ventricular muscle is mediated, at least in part, by a decrease in cardiac alpha 1-adrenoceptor density.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Our previous work suggests that opioid peptides modulate sensory nerves in the perfused rat mesentery. Therefore we tested the hypothesis that opioids are involved in the ongoing regulation of sensory nerve activity using selective opioid receptor antagonists. In the presence of guanethidine and methoxamine, transmural nerve stimulation caused a vasodilator response which was potentiated significantly by naloxone (3 x 10(-7) M). However, naloxone did not affect vasodilator responses to exogenous calcitonin gene related peptide. IC1 174.864 (3 x 10(-7) M), a selective delta receptor antagonist, had no effect on vasodilator responses to transmural nerve stimulation. In contrast CTOP (D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn-Thr-Phe-Thr-NH2) (3 x 10(-7) M), a selective mu receptor antagonist, significantly inhibited vasodilator responses to transmural nerve stimulation, effects which were abolished by naloxone treatment. In preparations pretreated with beta-FNA (beta-funaltrexamine HCl), an irreversible mu receptor antagonist, naloxone no longer potentiated vasodilator responses to transmural nerve stimulation. These results suggest that potentiation of vasodilator responses to transmural nerve stimulation by naloxone may be due to blockade of mu receptors, resulting in a reduced inhibitory modulation by endogenous opioids. These findings support the contention that prejunctional opioid receptors on sensory nerves may play a role in modulating activity of the cardiovascular system."
"The effect of a number of adrenergic agonists and antagonists on the induction of rat salivary cystatin was investigated. A highly sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay was used to determine cystatin in rat whole saliva. Treatment for 10 consecutive days with a non-specific beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, or the beta 1-adrenergic agonists dobutamine or methoxyphenamine, resulted in the induction of the salivary cystatin. Induction was also found in rats treated for 10 days with arterenol. Only trace quantities of cystatin could be detected in saliva of rats treated with the beta 2-adrenergic agonists terbutaline or salbutamol. When isoproterenol was injected concomitantly with the mixed beta-antagonist propranolol or the beta 1-adrenergic antagonists metaprolol, proctocol or atenolol the production of cystatin was totally suppressed. However, the beta 2-antagonist, ICI 118551, produced only a partial reduction in salivary cystatin induction elicited by isoproterenol. The findings suggest that the induction of salivary cystatin is regulated, in part, by beta 1-adrenergic receptor stimulation."
"New duplicated analogs of the alpha 1-selective agonist methoxamine and of its cyclic derivative 5,8-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-naphthylamine have been synthesized and tested for their adrenergic properties. All the compounds prepared, presenting a polymethylene spacer of varying length between two units of the active structure, turned out to be completely devoid of any alpha-stimulating activity. Surprisingly, some of them showed a marked beta-adrenergic agonistic effect, being the most interesting compound active at nanomolar concentration."
"We investigated left ventricular (LV) early diastolic filling in 10 normal conscious dogs that had been previously instrumented to measure LV and left atrial (LA) pressures and three orthogonal LV internal dimensions. LV volume was calculated as a general ellipsoid. The pressure within a passive structure increases as it is filled. If myocardial relaxation is rapid enough to substantially aid LV diastolic filling, it may overcome this effect and cause LV pressure to fall despite an increase in volume. Thus, we defined the amount of LV filling that occurred while LV pressure was falling as relaxation filling, which is a measure of the importance of LV relaxation during early diastolic filling. The time constant of relaxation (T) was derived from the exponential fall of LV pressure during isovolumic relaxation. While LV pressure was falling early in diastole (the relaxation filling period), all three LV diameters increased. Autonomic blockade with hexamethonium (5 mg/kg) and atropine (0.1 mg/kg) reduced relaxation filling from 21 +/- 6\% (mean +/- SD) to 12 +/- 3\% of the stroke volume (p less than 0.01). The mean LA pressure also was significantly decreased (from 12 +/- 2 to 10 +/- 5 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), while the duration of the relaxation filling period and T were unchanged. Positive inotropic stimulation with dobutamine (10 micrograms/kg/min) shortened T without changing LA pressure. The maximum LA-LV pressure gradient, dV/dtmax, and relaxation filling all increased. Augmented preload produced by dextran infusion (500 ml/10 min) caused an increase in LA pressure (from 11 +/- 3 to 21 +/- 8 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) without altering T. This also increased the maximum LA-LV pressure gradient, dV/dtmax, and relaxation filling. Augmented afterload produced by methoxamine (10 mg/3 min i.v.) significantly increased LA pressure (from 9 +/- 4 to 15 +/- 10 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) and lengthened T (from 35 +/- 4 to 50 +/- 7 msec, p less than 0.05) and the duration of relaxation filling (from 36 +/- 5 to 44 +/- 9 msec, p less than 0.01) without altering the maximum LA-LV pressure gradient, dV/dtmax, or LV relaxation filling. Incremental changes in heart rate induced by atrial pacing (from 100-180 beats/min) resulted in progressive decreases in the time constant of LV relaxation and the duration of relaxation filling. The LA pressure was also decreased. There was no corresponding increase in the amount of active LV filling until the heart rate reached 180 beats/min. During all these interventions, T correlated with the duration of LV relaxation filling (r = 0.99. p less than 0.05). The amount of relaxation filling and dV/dtmax both correlated with the maximum LA-LV pressure gradient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
"The purpose of this study was to determine the receptor subtype mediating enhanced contractile responses of aortae and mesenteric arteries from diabetic rats to the alpha-adrenoceptor agonists, norepinephrine, clonidine, and methoxamine and to establish whether the enhanced responses are associated with increased release of intracellular Ca2+ or are dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+. The pA2 values calculated for the alpha 1-selective antagonist prazosin were similar in arteries from control and diabetic rats and were 2.5-3 log units greater than pA2 values calculated for the alpha 2-selective antagonist yohimbine. Contractile responses of aortae incubated in Ca2(+)-free Krebs' solution containing 1 mM EGTA to maximal but not to ED50 concentrations of the alpha-adrenoceptor agonists were significantly greater in preparations from diabetic than from control rats. Following readdition of Ca2+, contractile responses of diabetic aortae to all concentrations of the agonists tested were significantly greater than control. Similar results were obtained in mesenteric arteries, except that no clonidine response could be detected in preparations from either diabetic or control rats in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. These data indicate that enhanced responses of arteries from diabetic rats to alpha-adrenoceptor agonists are mediated by alpha 1 adrenoceptors, and are largely dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+. However, increased release of intracellular Ca2+ appears to contribute to enhanced responses to high concentrations of these agonists."
"1. Nasal resistance in anaesthetized rats was assessed by measuring air overflow during ventilation of the nasal passages at constant pressure. Nasal basal resistance was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by methoxyphenamine hydrochloride (0.01-30 mg kg-1, i.v.), pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (0.03-3 mg kg-1, i.v.) and adrenaline bitartrate (0.01-3 micrograms kg-1, i.v.). Both methoxyphenamine and pseudoephedrine were less potent and less efficacious than adrenaline but caused longer-lasting responses. 2. Nasal congestion induced by histamine (0.2\% nebulised solution passed into the nasal passages for 15 s) was inhibited by i.v. administration of methoxyphenamine, pseudoephedrine, adrenaline, methoxamine or tyramine: the ID50s against 0.2\% histamine-induced nasal congestion were 1.16 (95\% confidence limits; 0.5, 1.8) mg kg-1, 0.25 (0.19, 0.33) mg kg-1, 0.037 (0.018, 0.06) micrograms kg-1, 8.12 (6.74, 9.65) micrograms kg-1 and 30.6 (26.1, 35.8) micrograms kg-1 respectively. 3. The inhibitory effects of both methoxyphenamine and tyramine on histamine-induced nasal congestion were reduced after administration of desmethylimipramine (0.1 and 1 mg kg-1, i.v.) or prazosin (0.1 and 0.3 mg kg-1, i.v.). Similarly, the inhibitory effects of methoxamine were reduced after prazosin (0.1 and 0.3 mg kg-1). 4. These results indicate that methoxyphenamine (1 mg kg-1, i.v.) inhibits histamine-induced nasal congestion in the rat. This action, at least in part, is probably indirect being mediated by release of neuronal noradrenaline which then acts on alpha 1-adrenoceptors."
"Postjunctional alpha-adrenoceptor characteristics were evaluated in canine dorsal pedal arterial and saphenous vein rings studied before and after development of severe pacing-induced heart failure (CHF). Before CHF, all agonists produced concentration-dependent increases in tension of both blood vessels. After development of CHF, the responsiveness and sensitivity of the vessels to the alpha 1-agonists and the mixed agonists were significantly increased as compared with control. The maximum responses to BHT 920 and BHT 933 remained unaltered after CHF, but both vessels showed decreased sensitivity to BHT 920. Before CHF, the rank order of potency with respect to norepinephrine (NE) for the dorsal pedal artery was as follows: NE greater than epinephrine greater than methoxamine greater than BHT 933 greater than BHT 920, and for the saphenous vein was epinephrine greater than NE greater than BHT 933 greater than methoxamine greater than BHT 920. At peak CHF, the rank order of potency for the artery was epinephrine greater than NE greater than methoxamine greater than BHT 933 greater than BHT 920, whereas in the vein BHT 920 was approximately 80 times less potent than NE (as compared with being only five times less potent before CHF). Prazosin was a potent, competitive antagonist (pA2 values of 9.2 and 9.0 for the artery and the vein) of methoxamine-induced contractions before development of CHF. Prazosin had a 10-fold lower potency against epinephrine-induced contractions in the dorsal pedal artery, whereas it was not competitive against epinephrine in the saphenous vein. Against the selective alpha 2-agonists, prazosin either showed no antagonism or was not competitive. After CHF, prazosin was non competitive against all agonists tested. Yohimbine was a potent, competitive antagonist against BHT 920 both before and at CHF. Yohimbine had intermediate antagonism against epinephrine and produced no antagonism of methoxamine-induced contractions. We conclude that increased reactivity and sensitivity of the peripheral vasculature to alpha 1-agonists occurs at CHF."
"The present study was undertaken to clarify whether there is a deficiency in the relaxation mediated by the adenylate cyclase-cyclic AMP (cAMP) system in the portal vein as compared to the saphenous vein. Longitudinal strips of the portal vein and helical preparations of the saphenous vein were used. The relaxation response to various agents was examined under conditions such that the venous preparations were previously contracted by methoxamine in equipotent concentrations (EC80), i.e., 10(-6) M for portal vein and 10(-5) M for saphenous vein. The saphenous vein relaxed fully in response to isoproterenol but the portal vein relaxed only to 29\% of the maximum relaxation induced by papaverine 10(-4) M. However, dibutyryl cAMP and 8-bromo-cAMP, membrane permeable derivatives of cAMP, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and papaverine, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and forskolin, a direct stimulator of adenylate cyclase, relaxed portal and saphenous veins similarly though with quantitative differences. The results suggest that there is no profound deficiency in the adenylate cyclase-cAMP system but there may be a deficiency in the coupling between surface beta-adrenoceptors and adenylate cyclase or there may be a low density of beta-adrenoceptors in the portal vein."
"Effects of acute myocardial infarction (48 h) on cardiovascular responses to (+/-)-, (-)-, and (+)-dobutamine were studied in isolated perfused rat hearts. The effects of the racemate and the isomers on ventricular pressure were measured simultaneously in infarcted left ventricle and noninfarcted right ventricle. Administration of (+/-)-, (-)-, and (+)-dobutamine resulted in dose-dependent increases in inotropic parameters and coronary flow (CF) in both control and in infarcted hearts. As compared with the (+)-isomer, the racemate and the (-)-isomer in both control and infarcted hearts were approximately 1.5 and 15 times weaker with respect to inotropic parameters. For (+/-)-, (-)-, and (+)-dobutamine, there was no significant difference in pD2 values in any of the inotropic measurements between the infarcted group and the corresponding control group. The maximal obtainable responses were significantly lower in the infarcted groups as compared with their corresponding control group. In control hearts, effects of isoproterenol and methoxamine as compared with (+/-)-dobutamine were approximately 2 log units more and 2 log units less in potency, respectively. The inotropic effects of (-)-dobutamine but not those of methoxamine were completely antagonized by propranolol (0.3 microM). Although the results provide evidence for the existence of myocardial alpha 1-adrenoceptors, all forms of dobutamine exerted positive inotropic effects through activation of beta-adrenoceptors both in control and in infarcted in rat hearts."
"Methoxamine, an alpha adrenoreceptor agonist, and sleep abolished repetitive nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in a 41-year-old man without detectable underlying heart disease. Detailed pacing studies revealed that the occurrence of ventricular tachycardia was totally dependent on the basic heart rate. Sleep and the alpha adrenoreceptor agonist abolished the ventricular tachycardia by slowing the basic heart rate. Verapamil, propranolol, and disopyramide were able to decrease the upper limit of the tachycardia-initiating heart rate, but none of them were able to increase the lower limit (75/min). Failure to increase the lower limit of the tachycardia-initiating heart rate was a major reason why these conventional antiarrhythmic drugs were unable to suppress his daytime episodes of repetitive ventricular tachycardia."
"The effect of methoxamine, a specific alpha 1-adrenergic agonist, on the release of T3, T4 and cAMP from perifused mouse thyroid was studied to clarify the role of the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor in the regulation of thyroid hormone secretion. TSH-stimulated T3 and T4 release was inhibited significantly by methoxamine. With regard to cAMP release, methoxamine inhibited TSH-stimulated cAMP release in the presence of 4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-2-imidazolidinone but did not inhibit TSH-stimulated cAMP release in the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Methoxamine did significantly suppress TSH-stimulated release of T3 and T4 in the presence of each phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Depletion of Ca2+ in the perifusion buffer abolished completely the inhibitory effect of methoxamine on TSH-stimulated T3 and T4 release. The present study suggests that activation of the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor inhibits TSH-stimulated T3 and T4 secretion through a Ca(2+)-dependent mechanism in the mouse thyroid gland."
"It has been shown that in vitro angiotensin II (Ang II) potently downregulates endothelin-1 (ET-1) binding sites. In this study, we investigated in vivo the interactions between the renin-angiotensin system and ET-1. Sprague-Dawley rats were pithed, ventilated, and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was recorded. ET-1 (1 nmol/kg) induced a biphasic response: a transient hypotension followed by a sustained increase of DBP. Captopril (5 mg/kg, i.v.) or Sar1-Ile8-Ang II (10 ng/kg/min) did not affect ET-1 responses. In other experiments, DBP was increased by infusion of methoxamine (MTX: 10, 20, 25, 32.5 micrograms/kg/min) or Ang II (50, 100, 150, 200 ng/kg/min). ET-1-induced hypotension correlated with the level of DBP (r = 0.94) for both agonists. The elevation of DBP in response to ET-1 was also related to the vascular tone but was dose-dependently attenuated by Ang II infusion when compared with MTX. Conversely, infusion of ET-1 (0.1 nmol/kg/min) blunted the pressor response to Ang II (0.1 micrograms/kg) but not to MTX (50 micrograms/kg). These doses induced the same increase of DBP in pithed control rats. Similarly, increased plasma renin activity induced by chronic salt depletion (0\% NaCl) in pithed rats provoked a shift to the right of the dose-response curves to Ang II and ET-1 but not to MTX. These results suggest an in vivo cross-desensitization between ET-1 and Ang II."
"Previously, we found that noradrenergic input through alpha 1-receptors modulates pulsatile release of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) in ovariectomized rhesus monkeys in the absence of estrogen. In the present study, the role of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in mediating alpha-adrenergic stimulation of LH-RH release is investigated. In the first experiment the effects of the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist methoxamine (MTX) on LH-RH and PGE2 release were examined. Push-pull perfusion of the stalk-median eminence (S-ME) was performed in conscious, ovariectomized monkeys, and perfusate samples were collected on ice. MTX (10(-5) M) was infused into the S-ME through the push cannula for 10 min at 90-min intervals, and LH-RH and PGE2 in aliquots of the same perfusate samples were measured by radioimmunoassay. Infusion of MTX significantly stimulated LH-RH release (n = 12; P less than 0.01) and PGE2 release (P less than 0.05). In the second experiment, the effect of PGE2 infusion on LH-RH release was tested. PGE2 (10(-7) M) was infused using the same protocol as above, and LH-RH was measured in the perfusates. Infusion of PGE2 through the push cannula significantly stimulated LH-RH release (n = 23; P less than 0.05). These results suggest that the stimulatory effect of MTX on LH-RH release is at least partly mediated by PGE2, since MTX stimulated not only LH-RH but also PGE2 release, and since PGE2 itself stimulated LH-RH release. Therefore, PGE2 may be an important endogenous mediator of alpha 1-adrenergic input stimulating pulsatile LH-RH release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"The functional response of the left ventricle with scar to increased afterload, was examined in 15 patients with old myocardial infarction and left ventricular aneurysm (OMI). Interventional cine left ventriculography during elevating left ventricular pressure with methoxamine. Wall motion was assessed by the radial and the centerline method. Augmented afterload didn't change ejection fraction in patients with OMI, but normalized wall motion (Z) increased in the aneurysmal region and decreased in the remote region in both methods. In the remote region in patients with OMI, afterload stress shortened left ventricular pressure-radial length (P-L) loops along length axis, and reduced percent systolic radial shortening (SS). In the aneurysmal region, P-L loops showed systolic elongation of length at rest and the slope of end-diastolic point to end-systolic point became steeper with increased afterload, resulting in a decrease of aneurysmal expansion. In summary, with increasing afterload, wall motion decreased in non-infarcted regions and increased in aneurysmal regions, in left ventricles with aneurysm. This mechanism may be interpreted as afterload-induced shifts of P-L loops in each region."
"The electron impact mass spectrometric properties of trimethylsilyl ether and fluoroacyl ester derivatives of trenbolone, combined or not combined with a methoxime group, are presented. Some derivatization problems were observed and were due to the formation of enol derivatives at the 3C-position in several tautomeric forms, which in their turn were not stable and lost two or four hydrogens under the conditions studied. The enolization could be minimized by carefully selecting the reaction conditions or could be prevented by the introduction of a methoxime group at the 3C-position. The limits of detection and identification of the methoxime heptafluorobutyryl ester and the methoxime trimethylsilyl ether derivative of trenbolone were determined using a mass selective detector in the electron impact mode and a triple-stage quadrupole in the methane positive chemical ionization mode. Selected reaction monitoring in tandem mass spectrometry did not improve the limit of detection, but because of the gain in selectivity did improve the limit of identification. The glucuronides of trenbolone and epitrenbolone could be identified in three urine specimens out of 200 samples in routine doping control."
"We measured the changes in central venous pressure (CVP) and circulating blood volume (CBV) in dogs consequent to fluid infusion under halothane anesthesia, and compared the CVP and CBV responses to those obtained after blocking the autonomic nervous system by total spinal anesthesia (TSA) and stimulating the alpha receptor with methoxamine (MTX). Under TSA, the change in CVP consequent to fluid infusion was less than that under halothane anesthesia, while with MTX, the change in CVP was larger than that under halothane anesthesia. The recovery time of CVP response toward the baseline level after the end of fluid infusion was fastest under halothane anesthesia, while the recovery time of CVP was two times longer under TSA and MTX. Based on the relationship between changes in CVP and BV, we quantified effective vascular compliance and stress relaxation using mathematical analysis. The effective vascular compliance increased to 13.3 +/- 3.2 ml.mmHg-1.kg-1 under TSA as compared to 5.6 +/- 0.3 ml.mmHg-1.kg-1 under halothane anesthesia, and it decreased to 2.6 +/- 0.2 ml.mmHg-1.kg-1 with MTX. Stress relaxation was determined as the time constant in the unit response of CVP. The time constant for stress relaxation was 39 +/- 7 min under halothane, 74 +/- 12 min with TSA, and 92 +/- 25 min with MTX. These results suggest that the autonomic nervous system modifies cardiac preload by changing effective vascular compliance and stress relaxation."
"We examined the effects of platelet-activating factor (PAF) on lung epithelial permeability by measuring the clearance of intratracheally administered 99m-technetium-labeled diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) in guinea-pigs which were anaesthetised, paralysed and mechanically ventilated. The clearance of the radiolabeled tracer molecule 99mTc-DTPA from airways to the blood was expressed as changes in counts/min corrected for background. For each guinea-pig, 99mTc-DTPA clearance was assessed before and after i.v. PAF administration, when tracheal pressure had returned to near control values. Doses of 10, 50 and 100 ng/kg of PAF caused dose-dependent increases in 99mTc-DTPA clearance of 7 +/- 3\%, 38 +/- 7\% and 65 +/- 11\% respectively. The respective effects of 0.5 mg/kg of the beta 2-adrenergic agonist salbutamol and 0.3 mg/kg of the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist methoxamine on the increase in lung epithelial permeability induced by 50 ng/kg PAF were also studied. Salbutamol significantly reduced the acute bronchoconstrictor effects of PAF, but did not affect the increase in lung epithelial permeability, which was 58 +/- 10\%. Conversely, methoxamine significantly enhanced the bronchoconstrictor effects of PAF but inhibited the lung epithelial permeability increase, which was only 10 +/- 13\%. In the absence of PAF, salbutamol significantly increased this permeability by 49 +/- 11\%, whereas methoxamine alone slightly reduced, it by -11 +/- 4\%. These results demonstrate that PAF increases lung epithelial permeability and suggest that vascular surface area recruitment may explain this increase."
"The objectives were (a) to describe the effects of vasoactive drugs in normal rats upon cardiovascular function assessed by computing aortic haemodynamic power and input impedance, each separated into their component parts, and (b) to study the relationship between left ventricular pulsatile power output and the vascular impedance.
Haemodynamic power and input impedance were computed from measurements of aortic blood pressure and flow in normal rats. The rats were then given an infusion of a vasoconstrictor drug (methoxamine) followed by a vasodilator drug (hydralazine) in order to study the effects of changes in vascular impedance upon haemodynamic power.
The measurements were made on pentobarbitone anaesthetised male Wistar rats of approximately 400 g body weight (10 infused with Hartmann's solution as controls and 10 infused with the drugs).
Aortic total haemodynamic power was between 9.96 mW and 10.37 mW during the control period and reached a maximum of 11.36 mW during the methoxamine infusion, but this difference was not statistically significant. It then decreased significantly to 4.32 mW by the end of the hydralazine infusion. Pulsatile power was only 0.32(SEM 0.08) mW (2.8\% of the total power) in the control state and decreased to 0.12(0.1) mW (1.7\%) during the methoxamine infusion, but increased to 0.59(0.15) mW (12.5\%) by the end of the hydralazine infusion. The vascular effects were complex and involved all four of the input impedance parameters--peripheral resistance, characteristic resistance, arterial compliance, and inertance. Reflex responses of the vascular wall were apparent as temporal changes in characteristic resistance and arterial compliance.
Changes in cardiovascular function can be described by computing haemodynamic power and input impedance and then separating these into their component parts. Administration of the vasoactive drugs affected left ventricular mean and pulsatile power output and all four components of the input impedance. The frequency distribution of left ventricular pulsatile power output may be matched to the vascular impedance in order to optimise tissue perfusion."
"1. Dose-response curves were obtained to bolus injections of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in Krebs'-perfused hindquarters of male Wistar rats. Vasoconstrictor responses to 5-HT (5.7-363 nmol/kg) were significantly attenuated in hindquarters of alloxan-treated 14 day diabetic rats compared with non-diabetics. 2. Infusion of the thromboxane A2 (TxA2)-mimetic U46619 (317 and 31.7, but not 3.17 nmol/L) significantly potentiated vasoconstrictor responses to 5-HT in Krebs'-perfused hindquarters of non-diabetic and diabetic rats. The degree of potentiation was similar for both groups. 3. In Krebs'-perfused hindquarters of non-diabetic rats, infusion of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine (8.96 mumol/L, which caused a rise in perfusion pressure intermediate in magnitude to that produced by infusion of 31.7 and 317 nmol/L U46619) did not significantly affect responses to bolus injections of 5-HT. 4. The same concentration of methoxamine did not cause a significant potentiation of vasoconstrictor responses to 5-HT (except for the two highest 5-HT doses, 182 and 363 nmol/kg) in hindquarters of diabetic rats. This potentiation was significantly less than that due to 317 nmol/L U46619, although there was no significant difference between the rise in basal perfusion pressures produced by these concentrations of methoxamine and U46619. 5. Infusion of the TxA2 receptor antagonist AH23848 (111 nmol/L) inhibited the potentiating effect of U46619 (317 nmol/L) on responses to 5-HT in both non-diabetic and diabetic rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"The effects of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on the neural control of renal blood flow were examined in anesthetized dogs. Intrarenal arterial infusion of ANP (alpha-hANP, 10 and 50 ng/kg per min) suppressed the decrease in renal blood flow but not the increase in renal venous plasma norepinephrine concentration induced by renal nerve stimulation (1 and 2 Hz, for 1 min). ANP also attenuated the blood flow response to intrarenal arterial injection of methoxamine (5-20 micrograms). These results suggest that ANP acts at a postsynaptic site to suppress adrenergically induced vasoconstriction in the dog kidney."
"The role of the endothelium in regulating coronary alpha-adrenergic tone was evaluated in isolated coronary arterial rings from dogs with and without pacing-induced congestive heart failure (CHF). The maximal contractile response to methoxamine was attenuated approximately 43\% (p less than 0.05) in both intact and denuded CHF rings compared with control. Conversely, norepinephrine-induced contractions were diminished 58\% in intact CHF vessels and 39\% in denuded CHF vessels (p less than 0.05). Denudation did not alter responses to methoxamine but significantly (p less than 0.05) augmented the tension generated by norepinephrine in both control (1.7-fold) and CHF (2.4-fold) arteries. In both intact control and CHF coronary arteries, norepinephrine elicited rapid, transient relaxations that preceded slow, sustained contractions; the initial relaxation phase was endothelium dependent, because denudation eliminated the response. Relaxations to the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist BHT 920 were also dependent on the presence of an endothelium. At peak CHF, endothelium-dependent relaxations to norepinephrine and BHT 920 were enhanced, whereas relaxations to nitroglycerin and acetylcholine were unaltered. The data suggest that alpha-adrenergic tone in canine coronary arteries is diminished by pacing-induced CHF because of a decrease in alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated constriction and an enhanced capacity of the endothelium to antagonize the direct vascular smooth muscle response of norepinephrine through endothelium-dependent, alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxations."
"The mechanism underlying the antihypertensive effect of acute and chronic administration of ketanserin was investigated in eight hypertensive patients. Intrabrachial artery infusions of serotonin and the selective alpha 1-adrenergic receptor agonist methoxamine were given before and 1 hour after a single oral dose of 20 mg ketanserin and after 4 weeks of treatment with 20 to 40 mg twice daily. Blood pressure was reduced by ketanserin both after the initial dose (p less than 0.01) and after 4 weeks of treatment (p less than 0.01). During placebo, serotonin, 1 ng/kg/min, increased forearm blood flow by 51\% +/- 9\% (p less than 0.01), whereas the highest dose induced a decrease in flow (-33\% +/- 6\%; p less than 0.01). Methoxamine elicited a vasoconstriction (p less than 0.001). These effects of serotonin and methoxamine were not influenced by either the initial dose of ketanserin or after 4 weeks of treatment. It is concluded that serotonin cannot be considered a general endogenous pressor agent in these patients. The antihypertensive effects of ketanserin cannot be attributed to either vascular alpha 1-receptor or serotonin, type 2, receptor blockade."
"This study was undertaken to elucidate whether alpha-1 adrenoceptor activity is beneficial to contractile dysfunction during reperfusion after a brief period of ischemia (stunned myocardium) in 54 open-chest dogs. Contractile dysfunction assessed by fractional shortening (FS) was observed 3 hours after the onset of reperfusion following 15 minutes of complete occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Pretreatment with prazosin (4 micrograms/kg/min i.c.) further deteriorated contractile dysfunction compared with the untreated condition (12.7 +/- 0.6\% versus 6.9 +/- 0.4\% with prazosin treatment, p less than 0.001). Conversely, alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists, methoxamine (1.0 microgram/kg/min i.c.) and norepinephrine (0.24 microgram/kg/min i.c.) with rauwolscine and propranolol, significantly attenuated contractile dysfunction (FS in the methoxamine-treated group, 17.3 +/- 0.3\%, p less than 0.001 versus the untreated group; FS in the norepinephrine-treated group, 18.0 +/- 0.9\%, p less than 0.05 versus 13.6 +/- 1.1\% in the propranolol group). Both adenosine release and hyperemic coronary flow response during the early reperfusion period were significantly attenuated in the prazosin-treated group, and both were enhanced in the alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation groups. These results suggest that beneficial effects of alpha 1-adrenoceptor activity may be due to the enhanced release of adenosine. To test the cause-effect relation between the extent of adenosine release and contractile dysfunction during reperfusion, 8-phenyltheophylline was infused to block adenosine receptors in the methoxamine-treated group. The treatment with 8-phenyltheophylline completely abolished (FS, 7.4 +/- 0.3\%) the beneficial effect of the enhanced adenosine release by alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation. Furthermore, in the prazosin-treated group, adenosine (9 micrograms/kg/min) was additionally infused into the left anterior descending coronary artery 5 minutes before and 2 hours after the onset of reperfusion. Both hyperemic coronary flow and contractile dysfunction (FS, 17.3 +/- 0.3\%) recovered to the levels of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation groups. However, treatment with papaverine could not prevent deleterious effects of prazosin despite the fact that comparable hyperemic flow was obtained. Instead, lactate production up to 10 minutes after the onset of reperfusion was significantly larger (p less than 0.01) despite augmented contractile function in the prazosin-treated and the 8-phenyltheophylline with methoxamine-treated groups compared with the untreated group. The electron microscopic examination revealed no irreversible myocardial injury with and without pharmacological interventions. Thus, we conclude that alpha 1-adrenoceptor activity can reduce the magnitude of myocardial stunning and that its cellular mechanism is due to enhanced adenosine release by alpha 1-adrenoceptor activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
"1. Using indo-1 as a calcium fluorescent probe, we have observed the following in striatal astrocytes in primary culture. 2. The stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors induces a rapid rise in cytosolic calcium resulting from an internal calcium mobilization followed by an external calcium influx (4-min duration). 3. The stimulation of beta 1-adrenoceptors evokes only a slight internal calcium mobilization (90-sec duration). 4. The simultaneous stimulation of beta 1- and alpha 1-adrenoceptors induces a more prolonged calcium influx (10 min). The latter phenomenon could explain the calcium-dependent synergistic effects of alpha 1 and beta stimulation on cAMP production already described in the brain."
"1. The chronotropic and inotropic responses of the young chick heart to noradrenaline have been investigated in isolated right atria, left atria and ventricular strips from 14-day-old chicks. 2. In the presence of desipramine and metanephrine to inhibit amine uptake, concentration-response curves to noradrenaline in all three tissues were shifted to the right by propranolol (1 microM) but were not altered by the presence of either phentolamine (5 microM) or prazosin (10 microM). 3. Similar results were obtained in the presence of cocaine (10 microM) and corticosterone (10 microM) to inhibit amine uptake. Propranolol (0.3-3.0 microM) produced rightward shifts of noradrenaline concentration-response curves which gave pA2 values of 8.1-8.4. Phentolamine (5 microM), in contrast, did not affect responses to noradrenaline in any tissue, either in the absence or presence of propranolol (1 microM). 4. Isoprenaline produced positive chronotropic responses in right atria and positive inotropic responses in left atria and ventricular strips. Methoxamine elicited positive inotropic responses in left atria but only negative chronotropic responses in right atria and negative inotropic responses in ventricular strips. 5. These results demonstrate that cardiac responses to noradrenaline in the chick heart are mediated via beta-adrenoceptors only, and that cardiac alpha-adrenoceptors are not involved in these responses."
"The effect of methoxamine on retrograde flow of spermatozoa into the urinary bladder of domestic cats during electroejaculation and the incidence of retrograde flow during the collection of semen with an artificial vagina, or during mating was examined. In experiment 1, urine collected by cystocentesis prior to electroejaculation was azoospermic or contained few, nonmotile spermatozoa, whereas urine collected after electroejaculation contained more (P = 0.002) spermatozoa, and motile spermatozoa were evident in urine obtained from 6 of 8 cats. Administration of methoxamine hydrochloride (200 micrograms/kg of body weight, IV) did not affect spermatozoal output or percentage of retrograde flow. Percentage of retrograde flow for control cats ranged from 61.18 to 92.95\% (mean +/- SD, 80.00 +/- 14.28\%) and for methoxamine-treated cats, ranged from 15.25 to 92.49\% (mean +/- SD, 58.10 +/- 32.28\%), but the difference was not significant. In experiment 2, an artificial vagina was used to collect semen from 5 of the 8 cats used in experiment 1. Urine collected by cystocentesis after ejaculation contained spermatozoa, and motile spermatozoa were evident in the urine from 4 of 5 cats. The mean (+/- SD) percentage of retrograde flow for these 5 cats was 46.82 +/- 31.67\% (range, 14.56 to 90.32\%). In experiment 3, each of the 5 cats that were used in experiments 1 and 2 were mated. Spermatozoa were recovered from the vagina of each mated female, and motile spermatozoa were also present in postejaculation urine obtained by cystocentesis from each of the 5 male cats. Mean total number of spermatozoa in the postmating urine was 29.42 +/- 33.58 x 10(6) (range, 0.22 x 10(6) to 76.05 x 10(6) spermatozoa).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"In perfused rat mesentery transmural nerve stimulation activates both adrenergic and capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves. When adrenergic nerves were blocked with guanethidine and smooth muscle tone was increased, transmural nerve stimulation caused a dilator response which was attenuated by tetrodotoxin and abolished by capsaicin. Indomethacin increased the vasodilator response to transmural nerve stimulation, but did not affect the dilation to calcitonin gene-related peptide. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) potentiated vasoconstrictor responses to transmural nerve stimulation, but suppressed capsaicin-sensitive vasodilation, an effect which was unaltered by indomethacin. Opioid agonists selective for mu, delta or kappa receptors, DAMGO ([D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin), DPDPE ([D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin) and ethylketocyclazocine, had no effect on the vasoconstrictor response to transmural nerve stimulation. DAMGO and DPDPE significantly inhibited vasodilator responses to transmural nerve stimulation, but ethylketocyclazocine was without effect. After treatment with indomethacin, DAMGO still inhibited the vasodilator response, but DPDPE was no longer effective. Prejunctional control of transmitter release by NPY or opioids is dependent on the specific nerve type as well as, in some cases, the participation of endogenous prostaglandins."
"In a study of the aortic component of the second heart sound (A2) intensity, using 10 dogs, miniature cardiac accelerometers were attached to the exposed left ventricle (LV) at the apex, and to the surface of proximal aorta, to obtain LV and aortic surface acceleration. Manometer tipped catheters were used to detect aortic systolic pressure and diastolic pressure and time constant of left ventricular pressure fall "T". Drugs (Nitroprusside, Dobutamine and Methoxamine) altered aortic pressure, LV contraction and LV relaxation. When T was +/- 35\% of control, the aortic systolic pressure and diastolic pressure were good predictors of A2 intensity. When LV relaxation was impaired, increasing T greater than 135\% of control, the A2 intensity for any given aortic pressure was reduced. When relaxation was hyperactive, decreasing T less than 65\% of control, A2 intensity was increased. Aortic pressure/T which assessed both aortic pressure and relaxation ability, is a better determinant of A2 intensity than aortic systolic pressure or aortic diastolic pressure alone."
"Peak filling rate is an indicator of left ventricular (LV) diastolic function. It is influenced by heart rate, loading conditions, sympathetic nervous system activity, ejection fraction and other factors. To determine the effect of altered loading conditions on peak filling rate, independent of heart rate and sympathetic nervous system activity, 12 patients were studied 3 weeks after orthotopic heart transplantation. Plasma catecholamine level, heart rate and ejection fraction were not changed by any maneuver. Nitroglycerin caused a decrease in pulmonary artery wedge pressure (9 +/- 2 to 6 +/- 1 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and in absolute peak filling rate (46.0 +/- 3.0 to 42.8 +/- 2.5 kcts/s, p less than 0.01), but no change in normalized peak filling rate. Volume infusion increased pulmonary artery wedge pressure (9 +/- 2 to 12 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and absolute peak filling rate (46.0 +/- 3.0 to 51.5 +/- 5.3 kcts/s, p less than 0.01), but peak filling rate normalized to stroke volume was unchanged. During nitroglycerin and volume infusions, there was a high correlation between changes in pulmonary artery wedge pressure and absolute peak filling rate (r = 0.82, p less than 0.001). With normalization of peak filling rate, these variables correlated less well. With methoxamine, 4 patients demonstrating systolic dysfunction had a decrease in absolute and normalized peak filling rate despite a large increase in pulmonary artery wedge pressure. The other 8 patients without systolic dysfunction had an increase in pulmonary artery wedge pressure with increased absolute but unchanged normalized peak filling rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Intracellular Ca (Cai) is an inhibitory second messenger in renin secretion, and it has been hypothesized that some first messengers--especially angiotensin II [A-II] and antidiuretic hormone [ADH], and possibly A1-adenosine receptor antagonists as well--increase Cai and thereby inhibit renin secretion by causing the release or mobilization of Ca from intracellular sites of sequestration. The present experiments were designed to test this hypothesis, by using 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid 8-(diethylamino)-octyl ester (TMB-8), a putative antagonist of Ca release from intracellular sequestration sites. The rat renal cortical slices preparation was used. Basal renin secretory rate was unaffected by 1 and 10 microM TMB-8, but more than doubled in response to 100 microM TMB-8. Basal renin secretory rate was inhibited by A-II (1 microM), by ADH (200 units/1), by an A1-adenosine receptor agonist (N6-cyclohexyladenosine, or CHA; 0.5 microM), and by an alpha-adrenergic agonist (methoxamine; 10 microM). Only the inhibitory effect of methoxamine was blocked by 1 and 10 microM TMB-8, but these concentrations had no effect on basal secretory rate. At 100 microM, TMB-8 blocked the inhibitory effects of ADH as well as of methoxamine, but failed to block the inhibitory effects of CHA and A-II. However, these observations cannot be taken as evidence that methoxamine and ADH, but not CHA and A-II, inhibit renin secretion by a mechanism involving release of Ca from intracellular sequestration sites, because 100 microM TMB-8 clearly had non-specific effects. Among them, it completely blocked the inhibitory effect of K-depolarization on renin secretion. Collectively, at least three separate actions of TMB-8 must be invoked to explain the present results. Likely candidates are an Na-channel blocking effect and a Ca channel blocking effect in addition to antagonism of the release of Cai."
"Non-cholinergic, non-adrenergic vasodilation has been studied by transmural field stimulation of the isolated rat hepatic artery and compared with responses in the splenic artery. In the hepatic artery with rubbed endothelium, transmural stimulation caused a contracture that was blocked by phentolamine and potentiated after capsaicin. After pretreatment with guanethidine in order to deplete the neuronal stores of noradrenaline, the methoxamine-contracted hepatic artery was significantly relaxed by transmural stimulation; more efficiently than the splenic artery. This relaxation of the hepatic artery was attenuated following a 30 min exposure to capsaicin and largely blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX). The relaxation by exogenous CGRP was independent of a functional endothelium. In contrast, vasodilation by substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NKA), was completely dependent on an intact endothelium. Exogenous CGRP caused a near-complete relaxation of the methoxamine-contracted hepatic artery both before and after capsaicin treatment. CGRP was a more efficient relaxant of the hepatic than the splenic artery. These findings show that responses to transmural stimulation of the hepatic artery are modulated after pretreatment with capsaicin, indicating release of relaxing substances such as CGRP, presumably from capsaicin-sensitive neuronal stores. In conclusion, CGRP is a likely mediator of neuronal vasodilation in the rat liver, independent of the state of the endothelium."
"The 3 isoforms of endothelin (ET) (potent peptidic vasoconstrictor isolated from endothelial cells) induce biphasic pressor effects when given intravenously: a transient hypotension followed by a long-lasting hypertension. The aim of this work was to study the regulatory effect of vascular tone on ET-induced pressor responses in the pithed rat. After pithing, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was elevated by continuous perfusion of angiotensin-II (AII) or methoxamine (MTX). When DBP was stabilized ET's isoforms (ET-1, ET-2, ET-3) were injected (1 nmol/kg). Solvent injection permitted to assess the stability of AII or MTX perfusions. Intravenous injections of ET induced a sharp hypotension which is more pronounced when initial DBP increased whatever the vasoactive substance used to elevate DBP. The maximal effects of each ET was identical but the hypotension is longer for ET-3 than for ET-1 and ET-2. The following hypertensive phase diminished when DBP increased but is strongly blunted in AII-supported rats when compared to MTX-supported rats. Furthermore, ET-3 appeared to be devoided of hypertensive effect in AII-supported pithed rats. These results indicate that AII is able to modulate ET-induced pressor response, whereas the initial hypotensive phase is only dependent of vascular tone."
"Pretreatment by inhalation with the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist methoxamine and the "loop" diuretic frusemide reduces the bronchial response to certain airway challenges in asthma. To test whether these drugs may act by altering airway epithelial ion and water transport, their effect on nasal potential difference (PD) when applied topically in eight normal volunteers was measured. For comparison, the effect of the Na(+)-channel blocking drug amiloride and the beta 2-adrenergic agonist salbutamol was also tested. Both methoxamine and frusemide significantly reduced PD: at the highest concentration given (10(-3) mol.l-1), there was a mean drop in PD from baseline of 39.5\% following methoxamine treatment (p less than 0.05) and a mean drop of 30.2\% following frusemide (p less than 0.05). Neither drug was as effective as amiloride, which caused a mean drop in PD of 27.5\% from baseline at 10(-6) mol.l-1 and a drop of 71.6\% at 10(-3) mol.l-1 (p less than 0.01 for each concentration). Salbutamol had no significant effect on PD (p greater than 0.05). We conclude that methoxamine and frusemide may derive their protective effect on some bronchial challenge, at least in part, from their effect on airway epithelial ion flux."
"The differing effects of angiotensin II (AT II) and five other vasoactive agents on the tissue blood flow in Yoshida rat ascites hepatoma AH 109 A were studied at the same electrode position by a hydrogen clearance method. The elevation of blood pressure by AT II resulted in a 3.4-fold increases in the tumor blood flow. However, when AT II was reinfused, it resulted in only 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 1.9 and 2.4-fold increases, respectively, after infusion of methoxamine, norepinephrine, metaraminol, epinephrine, and phenylephrine. A pronounced reduction and further reducing tendency in the tumor blood flow were found after administration of norepinephrine and epinephrine. In addition, metaraminol, phenylephrine, and methoxamine did not change significantly the blood flow of the tumor. The results of this present blood flow study further suggest that AT II acts more peripherally in the host vascular bed from which newly growing tumor vessels bud than other vasoconstrictors do."
"The alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonistic effect of SGB-1534, a novel phenylpiperazine derivative, was examined in the renal vascular bed of pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. Renal nerve stimulation (RNS, 1 ms duration, 2, 3 and 4 Hz) or intrarenal bolus injection of methoxamine (0.5, 1 and 2 micrograms/kg) or guanabenz (1, 3 and 10 micrograms/kg) produced a frequency- or dose-dependent decrease in renal blood flow (RBF). Both the RBF responses to RNS and methoxamine were inhibited dose dependently by an intrarenal infusion of SGB-1534 (1-30 ng/kg per min) or prazosin (30-300 ng/kg per min). When the equipotent inhibitory doses of the antagonists were compared, the antagonistic potency of SGB-1534 on the RBF responses evoked by RNS and methoxamine was about 30 times greater than that of prazosin. Prazosin also attenuated the RBF response to guanabenz, whereas SGB-1534 had little effect. These results suggest that SGB-1534 has a selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor-blocking property and that it inhibits neurally mediated renal vasoconstriction. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonistic potency and selectivity of SGB-1534 may be greater than that of prazosin."
"In the pithed rat we investigated the cardiovascular properties of d,l-nebivolol and its enantiomers. We used the increase in heart rate elicited by (-)-adrenaline and (-)-noradrenaline as a model for studying beta 1-adrenoceptors. A leftward shift of the logarithmic dose-pressor response curve of (-)-adrenaline reflects beta 2-adrenoceptor-blocking properties. The blood pressure responses of methoxamine, B-HT 920 and serotonin (5-HT) were studied in order to test whether d,l-nebivolol has alpha 1-, alpha 2- and 5-HT2-receptor-blocking properties. Furthermore, the interaction of d,l-nebivolol with the peripheral sympathetic neurotransmission was investigated in pithed rats by electrical stimulation of the spinal cord. d,l-Nebivolol and d-nebivolol (threshold concentration 10(-8) mol/kg) were demonstrated to be selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonists. l-Nebivolol was a factor of 1,000 less potent as beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker. Up to a dose of 10(-5) mol/kg, d,l-nebivolol appeared to have neither alpha 1-, alpha 2-, beta 2-, 5-HT2-, angiotensin II-receptor antagonistic, calcium entry blocking, converting enzyme inhibiting nor direct vasodilating properties and did not interact with the sympathetic neurotransmission in the vascular wall. An explanation for an antihypertensive effect independent of beta-adrenoceptor blockade as found in spontaneously hypertensive rats and man could not be found in this model, therefore we suggest that this blood-pressure-lowering effect does not originate from conventional peripheral mechanisms."
"1. The significantly greater rise in blood pressure during the first 20 weeks of life in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) when compared with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) may be related to increased vasoconstrictor responses caused by enhanced transmitter release or post-junctional receptor changes. 2. The reactivity of rat isolated aorta to post-junctional alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation by methoxamine and to transmural sympathetic nerve stimulation was studied in ring segments suspended at equivalent transmural pressures in organ baths. 3. Wall stress in the SHR aorta was significantly higher at 4 weeks, but lower at 9 and 20 weeks when compared with the WKY aorta, a possible adaptation to the higher pressures seen in the SHR at the latter ages. 4. The sensitivity (location of EC50) to methoxamine was similar at all ages in both strains, but the SHR aortae at 9 and 20 weeks generated higher maximal contractile force to this agent compared with the WKY aorta. 5. The increase in force to methoxamine parallelled the medial hypertrophy of the SHR aorta, determined from computerized morphometric analysis. 6. There was an enhanced response to transmural field stimulation in the SHR aortae at 9 weeks, that was not accounted for by medial hypertrophy or altered neuronal uptake of noradrenaline. 7. These studies suggest that enhanced maximal contractile force in the SHR aorta to alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation is accounted for by medial hypertrophy. However, there is an additional enhanced reactivity at 9 weeks in response to nerve stimulation in the SHR aorta that may be related to increased innervation density."
"The adrenergic system is involved in the neural control of GH secretion with both stimulatory and inhibitory influences mainly mediated via GHRH and/or somatostatin modulation. To throw further light on adrenergic neuroregulation of somatotrophic function in man, the effect of various catecholamine agonists and antagonists on basal or GHRH-stimulated GH secretion was studied. Twenty-one adult males aged 20-30 years underwent the following studies: 1. clonidine (CLON), alpha 2-agonist, (15 micrograms/min infused i.v. from 0 to +10 min) alone and preceded by yohimbine (YOH), alpha 2-antagonist, (30 mg orally at -50 min); 2. GHRH (GHRH 44, 1 microgram/kg i.v. bolus at 0 min) alone and preceded by YOH; 3. CLON alone and combined with methoxamine (METHOX), alpha 1-agonist, (1 mg/min infused i.v. from -10 to +10 min); 4. GHRH alone and combined with i.v. infusion of phentolamine (PHEN), alpha 1/alpha 2-antagonist, (0.5 mg/min from -60 to +30 min); 5. GHRH alone and combined with i.v. infusion of salbutamol (SAL), beta 2-agonist, (10 micrograms/min from -5 to +15 min). The GH response to CLON was inhibited by YOH (area under the response curve, mean +/- S.E.: 672.6 +/- 143.0 vs. 219.6 +/- 16.7 micrograms/l/h, P less than 0.05) but was not modified by METHOX (278.4 +/- 94.1 vs. 216.7 +/- 115.5 micrograms/l/h). On the other hand, YOH was unable to affect the GH response to GHRH (339.3 +/- 19.1 vs. 518 +/- 172.8 micrograms/l/h).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"The racemic compound carvedilol possesses two complementary pharmacological effects, vasodilation and beta-blockade. The R- and S-enantiomers of carvedilol and the racemate were investigated with respect to the beta-blocking, vasodilating, and hypotensive actions. In agreement with results obtained with other beta-blockers, only the S-enantiomer of carvedilol exerts beta-blocking effects. In contrast, no substantial difference between the enantiomers could be seen with respect to alpha-blockade. The greater hypotensive activity of S-carvedilol may be attributed to beta-blockade, which inhibits counter-regulatory mechanisms provoked by vasodilation. From these results it is concluded that there is a rationale for using carvedilol as the racemate. Using the S-enantiomer would lead to relatively strong beta-blockade with only a weak vasodilating effect. The R-enantiomer alone would act only as a hypotensive agent without beta-blockade."
"In rat working hearts, alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine increased LVP, +/- dP/dtmax, ABF and HR in the presence of propranolol. But alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist B-HT 920 was ineffective. The changes induced by phenylephrine were antagonized by prazosin. In normotensive pithed rats, iv methoxamine dose-dependently increased LVP, +/- dP/dtmax, LVEDP, SAP and DAP. The changes in haemodynamics elicited by iv methoxamine were also antagonized by pretreatment with prazosin, and were attenuated by nifedipine (1 mg/kg, ia). In these two experiments, the increase in HR developed more slowly. The results suggest that postjunctional alpha 1-adrenoceptors, which exist in rat myocardium, produce a positive inotropic effect, which is possibly dependent on influx of extracellular calcium. Postjunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors-mediated effects were not found in rat myocardium in our functional studies."
"To determine whether enhanced sympathetic tone contributes to the maintenance of chronic angiotensin II (A II, 10 ng/min i.v. for 10 days) hypertension in rats, sympathetic activity was assessed in hypertensive and control rats by measuring norepinephrine (NE) turnover (alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine) in peripheral organs and by measuring depressor responses to ganglionic blockade in conscious rats. Pressor responses to methoxamine (1-8 micrograms/min) and arginine vasopressin (0.5-4 ng/min) were also obtained in rats with ganglionic blockade. Chronic A II infusion produced significant hypertension (mean +/- S.E. tail cuff pressure: 176 +/- 5 vs. 134 +/- 2 mm Hg in controls; n = 23 each group) but there were no significant differences in NE turnover in heart, kidney, skeletal muscle, or intestine in hypertensive rats compared with controls. Ganglionic blockade produced a significantly larger decrease in mean arterial pressure in A II-treated rats when compared with controls (73 +/- 7 vs. 38 +/- 2 mm Hg, n = 18 for each group). Dose-response curves for methoxamine and vasopressin were not significantly different between groups. The results suggest that the maintenance of chronic A II hypertension does not involve postsynaptic interactions between A II and the sympathetic system. The NE turnover data do not support the hypothesis that rats with chronic A II hypertension have enhanced sympathetic tone."
"The effects of intrathecally administered adrenergic agonists (alpha-1-methoxamine, alpha-2-dexmedetomidine, clonidine, and ST-91, beta-isoproterenol) on nociceptive (tail-flick reflex) and cardiovascular changes (blood pressure and heart rate) evoked by immersing the tail in 53 degrees C water were examined in rats anesthetized with halothane (0.75\%) and in which intrathecal catheters had been chronically implanted. Administration of intrathecal alpha-2, but not alpha-1 or beta agonists, produced a dose-dependent block of the tail-flick and evoked cardiovascular responses with the order of activity being as follows: dexmedetomidine greater than clonidine greater than ST-91 much greater than methoxamine greater than or equal to isoproterenol. These effects were readily reversed by the alpha-2 antagonist idazoxan. Intravenously administered dexmedetomidine at a dose that is active when given intrathecally (0.33 micrograms) was without effect on either the tail-flick or the evoked cardiovascular responses. Without drugs, the halothane MAC was 1.23 +/- 0.07\%. In the presence of intrathecally administered dexmedetomidine (0.33 micrograms), the MAC was significantly reduced to 0.9 +/- 0.09\%. The intrathecal administration of alpha-2 agonists resulted in a rapid decrease in resting blood pressure and heart rate with the magnitude of hypotension being as follows: dexmedetomidine greater than clonidine greater than ST-91. These data suggest a potent spinal alpha-2-receptor-mediated modulation of somatomotor and autonomic responses to pain."
"There is presently no consensus as to the nature of the catecholaminergic influence on the regulation of corticotropin-releasing factor. The potential role that the alpha-adrenergic system plays was investigated by measuring hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor-like immunoreactivity and plasma adrenocorticotropin, following manipulation of alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptor activation. Administration of the alpha-1 agonist methoxamine did not significantly alter either plasma adrenocorticotropin or hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor. Administration of the alpha-2 agonist clonidine resulted in a 24-fold increase in plasma adrenocorticotropin and a significant decrease in median eminence corticotropin-releasing factor, consistent with its release. Corticotropin-releasing factor in the remainder of the hypothalamus was not altered. Concurrent administration of clonidine with the selective alpha-2 antagonist yohimbine prevented the clonidine-induced changes in plasma adrenocorticotropin and hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor, consistent with the clonidine effect being mediated through alpha-2 receptors. Concurrent administration of clonidine with methoxamine did not prevent these effects, suggesting that the effect of clonidine was not mediated through presynaptic inhibition of noradrenergic adrenergic neurotransmission. Inhibition of protein synthesis by anisomycin induced changes in corticotropin-releasing factor and adrenocorticotropin which were not altered by combined treatment with methoxamine or clonidine. These data suggest differential roles for alpha-1 and alpha-2 systems in the regulation of corticotropin-releasing factor. Results from alpha-2 adrenergic activation were consistent with stimulation of corticotropin-releasing factor release, an effect mediated by a postsynaptic alpha-2 mechanism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"1. Electrical stimulation induced tritium release from branches of human middle cerebral arteries preincubated with [3H]noradrenaline (NA), which was reduced by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists, clonidine and B-HT 920, and not affected by the alpha 1-agonist, methoxamine. 2. The stimulated tritium release was inhibited by yohimbine (alpha 2-antagonist), and increased by phentolamine (alpha-antagonist) and prazosin (alpha 1-antagonist). 3. The inhibitory effect of clonidine was antagonized by yohimbine. 4. NA uptake was markedly reduced when the interval between the death and the autopsy was greater than 5 hr. 5. These data indicates the existence of presynaptic inhibitory alpha 2-adrenoceptors, but not alpha 1, in human cerebral arteries, and that the adrenergic nerve endings start to degenerate from 5 hr after death."
"The pattern of adrenergic innervation and the responsiveness to alpha-agonists of the epididymal and prostatic portions of the ductus deferens from young and aging rats were examined. The histochemical pictures showed that the distribution of the adrenergic fibres varies between the 2 ends of the ductus deferens, with a greater density in the prostatic portion. Tissues from rats aged 20 months showed the same difference in the adrenergic pattern between the 2 portions. Generally, the fluorescent bundles from the tissues of senescent animals seemed to be more numerous and compact. The functional data appear to be in contrast with the morphological observations, because the epididymal tract of young rats showed the highest responsiveness to alpha-agonists. An inverse correlation between the number of adrenergic fibres and receptor responsiveness is hypothesized."
"It has recently been shown, that common carotid occlusion (CCO) impairs autoregulation of renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This study was designed to investigate the mechanisms by which a moderate sympathetic stimulus influences RBF and GFR autoregulation. CCO provided a moderate sympathetic stimulus, and impaired autoregulation by increasing the lower autoregulatory limit of RBF and GFR by 21-30 mmHg. Basal RBF and GFR were not affected. A low-dose intrarenal infusion of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine (which did not change total RBF or GFR) induced a similar shift as CCO (n = 5, RBF: +31 +/- 11 mmHg, P less than 0.05; GFR: +24 +/- 4 mmHg, P less than 0.01). In another group it was shown, that a combination of CCO with an intrarenal angiotensin II (A II) blockade (saralasin) did not significantly alter the response to CCO (n = 7). These data suggest an alpha 1-adrenergic pathway for the sympathetic resetting of autoregulation. An augmented A II formation does not play a major role in mediating this effect."
"The alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonistic potency of midaglizole was evaluated and compared with that of the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists yohimbine and idazoxan. Intravenously administered midaglizole, like yohimbine and idazoxan, reversed the clonidine-induced inhibition of the tachycardic response to cardiac nerve stimulation in pithed rats. Midaglizole, yohimbine and idazoxan inhibited the pressor responses to B-HT 920 (alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist), in a dose-related manner, to a greater extent than the response to methoxamine (alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist). Conversely, prazosin produced a highly selective antagonism of the methoxamine-evoked response in this preparation. Midaglizole failed to antagonize centrally mediated hypotension and bradycardia induced by intravenous clonidine, whereas the other alpha 2-antagonists attenuated the clonidine-induced cardiovascular responses in intact rats. These results suggest that midaglizole is a selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist and, unlike yohimbine and idazoxan, is characterized by its ability to block peripheral but not central alpha 2-adrenoreceptors when administered systemically."
"In order to assess the roles of central adrenoceptors in the release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), aldosterone (ALD), vasopressin (AVP) and renin as well as in the regulation of renal and cardiovascular functions, either norepinephrine (NE; 0.07 microgram/kg/min), guanabenz (GB; alpha 2-agonist; 0.4 microgram/kg/min), methoxamine (MET; alpha 1-agonist; 0.4 microgram/kg/min), or isoproterenol (ISO; beta-agonist; 0.07 microgram/kg/min), dissolved in the artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), was intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) administered at a rate of 10 microliters/min for 30 min in anesthetized dogs. In the control study, the drugs were omitted. NE decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP), urinary osmolality (Uosm) and plasma ALD and AVP concentrations, and increased urine flow (UF). GB increased UF and urinary K excretion without any changes in urinary Na excretion, but decreased plasma ALD and AVP, heart rate, and Uosm without changes in MAP. ISO decreased MAP and plasma ALD, and increased Na and K output, renal plasma flow and UF with decreased Uosm. MET and ACSF failed to affect any of these parameters. Glomerular filtration rate, plasma ANP concentration and renin activity did not change in any of the studies. The present results suggest that central alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptors may attenuate ALD and/or AVP release without changes in ANP and renin release, and decrease blood pressure, thereby causing a diuresis and natriuresis."
"Slices and synaptosomes from human cerebral cortex (which had to be removed to reach deeply located tumours) and, for comparison, synaptosomes from guinea-pig and rat cerebral cortex were preincubated with [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine and superfused with physiological salt solution containing an inhibitor of 5-hydroxytryptamine uptake. The effects of alpha-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists on the electrically (slices) or potassium-evoked (synaptosomes) tritium overflow were studied. In human cerebral cortical slices, the electrically-evoked [3H] overflow was inhibited by noradrenaline (pIC25 value: 6.35); the non-selective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine, at a concentration of 0.32 mumol/l, strongly antagonized the inhibitory effect of noradrenaline (apparent pA2 value: 8.19) but did not affect the evoked overflow by itself. In synaptosomes from humans, guinea-pigs and rats, noradrenaline also inhibited the K(+)-evoked [3H] overflow in a concentration dependent manner; the alpha 2-adrenoceptor clonidine (1 mumol/l), but not the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine (1 mumol/l), mimicked the effects of noradrenaline; the effect of noradrenaline (0.3 mumol/l) was abolished by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan (0.5 mumol/l), but not by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (1 mumol/l). It is concluded that release-inhibiting adrenoceptors of the alpha 2-subtype exist on 5-hydroxytryptamine terminals innervating the cerebral cortex in human and guinea-pig brain."
"1. The intracellular mechanism(s) underlying the decrease of a transient outward K+ current (It) induced by alpha 1-adrenergic agonists was studied in isolated adult rabbit atrial myocytes using whole-cell voltage clamp and cell-attached patch clamp techniques. Experiments were carried out at 22-23 degrees C. 2. Application of the specific alpha 1-adrenergic agonist, methoxamine, produced a decrease in It which was irreversible after the non-hydrolysable GTP analogues, GTP gamma S and Gpp(NH)p, had been introduced into cells via the recording micropipette. 3. Pre-treatment of cells with 0.1-0.15 microgram/ml pertussis toxin (PT) for 8-9 h at 30-34 degrees C did not prevent the alpha 1-induced decrease in It. Yet, this protocol, as measured by the PT-catalysed incorporation of [32P]ADP-ribose in membrane-associated 40 and 41 kDa proteins, effectively caused the ADP-ribosylation of approximately 70\% of the PT-sensitive GTP-binding proteins (i.e. Gi) in these treated cells. After taking into account the proportion of non-viable cells (20-30\%), the effectiveness of this treatment probably approaches 100\% in the viable myocytes from which electrophysiological recordings were made. 4. Cell-attached patch recordings showed that bath application of methoxamine altered the single-channel events underlying It by decreasing their opening probability. Averaged currents from ensemble single-channel openings recorded in the presence of 0.2 mM-methoxamine outside the patch reproduced the features of alpha 1-adrenergic modulation of the macroscopic It observed during whole-cell voltage clamp measurements. This observation provides evidence for the involvement of a diffusible intracellular second messenger in the alpha 1-adrenergic modulation of It. 5. The protein kinase C (PKC) activators, 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG) increased It, when included in the bath perfusate, whereas the inactive analogues, 4 alpha-phorbol and 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, had no effect on It. 6. Exposure of cells to the PKC inhibitors, staurosporine and H-7, either by bath superfusion or intracellularly, via the recording micropipette, did not block the decrease in It produced by methoxamine. 7. Prolonged stimulation of atrial myocytes for 7-9 h at 22 degrees C with 500 nM-PMA produced a 'down-regulation' of endogenous PKC activity, as well as a physical loss of the immunoreactive enzyme, as measured by an in vitro assay, and an anti-PKC monoclonal antibody, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
"To assess the influence of autonomic regulation on automaticity in patients with intrinsic sinus node dysfunction, heart rate responses to autonomic drugs were evaluated in 28 patients with sick sinus syndrome and in 8 normal subjects. Heart rates before and after intravenous administration of isoproterenol (Isp), propranolol, atropine, and methoxamine were measured. To compare the results with electrophysiologic data, heart rate and automaticity recovery time (ART) before and after pharmacologic autonomic blockade (AB) were evaluated. Seventeen patients without syncope showed a similar heart rate response after administration of Isp to that of normal subjects, but 11 patients with syncope showed a significantly lower response than patients without syncope. Responses to atropine and methoxamine were lower and response to propranolol was larger in patients as compared to normal subjects. However, no significant difference was observed between patients with and without syncope. Twelve patients showed severely prolonged max ART exceeding 5000 msec after AB. Seven of them showed preserved response to Isp and max ART before AB was significantly shorter than that after AB. The other 5 patients with lower response to Isp showed no significant change in max ART before and after AB. In conclusion, sympathetic regulation in patients with preserved response to Isp might compensate for the impaired intrinsic automaticity in preventing syncope even in patients with severely impaired intrinsic sinus node function."
"The transmural distribution of fiber angles and the extent of shortening among obliquely oriented fibers are likely to be major determinants of the twisting motion that accompanies left ventricular (LV) ejection. As such, measurements of torsion may provide useful information about LV contractile function, but other factors, such as ventricular loading conditions, may also regulate this motion.
Torsion angles (theta i) of midventricular and apical regions were measured relative to a reference minor axis near the base in seven human cardiac allografts from biplane radiographic images of metallic midwall markers. Pressure loading with methoxamine (5-10 muk/kg/min) increased LV end-systolic pressure by 41 +/- 14 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001). Volume loading with normal saline raised LV end-diastolic pressure from 9.9 +/- 5.2 to 19.6 +/- 4.9 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001). These alterations in LV loading conditions were associated with no change in theta i (difference not significant) for any marker site. Inotropic stimulation with dobutamine (5 micrograms/kg/min) increased values of theta i by as much as twofold (p less than 0.05); this response varied considerably depending on marker location, with the middle and apical inferior wall and the apical lateral wall being the most sensitive. When the marker site associated with the largest torsion angle (theta max) was considered in each patient, dobutamine increased theta max in all cases (25.2 +/- 10.5 degrees versus 15.8 +/- 7.7 degrees, p less than 0.001), whereas pressure and volume loading had negligible effects. This 59\% increase in theta max was greater than that of conventional load-dependent indexes of LV systolic performance such as stroke volume (16\%), ejection fraction (22\%), and maximum rate of LV pressure rise (52\%).
This component of LV motion is relatively insensitive to alterations in preload and afterload, while changes in contractile state influence LV torsion in a regionally heterogeneous manner. Quantification of LV torsion may, therefore, provide a sensitive and relatively load-independent measure of contractile performance that may prove to be useful in the serial assessment of LV function."
"The rate of appearance of the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) in the regional venous drainage (NE spillover) can be estimated based on intravenous or intra-arterial infusions of [3H]NE. The present study examined whether forearm NE spillover (FASO) in humans depends on forearm blood flow (FBF) and on the site of infusion of the tracer. Healthy volunteers underwent infusions of [3H]NE and [3H]isoproterenol (Iso) administered intravenously (n = 21), intra-arterially (n = 32), or by both routes in the same experimental session (n = 7). FBF was manipulated by intra-arterial infusions of the vasodilator sodium nitroprusside (n = 7) or the vasoconstrictor methoxamine (n = 7). Forearm extraction percents of [3H]NE exceeded those of [3H]Iso in all subjects undergoing intravenous infusions (54 vs. 46\%, P less than 0.001), whereas extraction percents of [3H]Iso exceeded those of [3H]NE when the tracers were infused intra-arterially. Regardless of the infusion site, FASO was positively correlated with FBF (r = 0.44, P less than 0.005). Nitroprusside increased FBF and FASO, and methoxamine decreased FBF and FASO. When the tracers were added to whole blood, 89\% of [3H]NE and 83\% of [3H]Iso remained in plasma after 1 min; although no further loss of [3H]NE occurred over time, only 60\% of the added [3H]Iso remained in plasma by 20 min. The results indicate that regional NE spillover is flow dependent, complicating inferences about regional sympathoneural activity. Intra-arterial infusion of [3H]NE results in higher estimates of regional NE spillover than does intravenous infusion of the tracer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"The alpha 1-receptor agonist methoxamine reduced, by a prazosin sensitive mechanism, the nerve stimulation evoked release of norepinephrine in the rat caudal artery. The effect of methoxamine was also antagonized by the purinoceptor antagonist 8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline suggesting an involvement of endogenous purines in this process. Indeed, methoxamine caused the release of adenine nucleotides and adenosine, an action which was blocked by prazosin. These results suggest that methoxamine releases ATP or a related purine which in turn decreases transmitter release by acting on prejunctional purinoceptors."
"Perinatal exposure to cocaine has been shown to cause morphological and neurobehavioral abnormalities. In the current study, neonatal rats were given an acute injection of cocaine (30 mg/kg s.c.) at 1, 3, 5, 8, 11 or 15 days of age, and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA examined over the ensuing 30 min period. Three brain regions were used that differ in their timetables of cell maturation: cerebellum, cerebral cortex and midbrain + brainstem. Cocaine inhibited DNA synthesis in all brain regions, with diminishing impact as the animals matured; by 15 days of age, the effect of cocaine was no longer significant. Inhibition of macromolecule synthesis was selective for DNA, as [3H]leucine incorporation into protein was much less affected by cocaine. Although inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation by a single injection of cocaine was short-lived, repeated administration could have cumulative effects: chronic treatment on days 2, 3 and 4 did not desensitize the adverse effect of a subsequent dose administered on day 5. Additionally, with chronic cocaine, the cerebellum displayed a pronounced rebound elevation of DNA synthesis 24 h after the last dose, a characteristic finding in delayed cell maturation. Inhibition of DNA synthesis by cocaine in developing brain was not secondary to ischemia, nor to local anesthesia, as alpha-adrenergic blockade with phenoxybenzamine afforded no protection, and lidocaine could not substitute for cocaine. In contrast, a small amount (15 micrograms) of cocaine injected directly into the central nervous system readily caused inhibition of DNA synthesis; the same dose given systemically had no effect. These data suggest that cocaine damages the developing brain, in part, through direct interference with DNA synthesis."
"The bronchial circulation is a physiological left-to-left shunt; the venous return of the bronchial arteries vascularising the intra-pulmonary bronchi drains directly into the left heart chambers. In cardiac failure, increased left ventricular filling pressures affects the bronchial circulation and causes stasis and congestion. Congestion of the arterial and venous bronchial microcirculation leads to thickening of the bronchial mucosa and submucosa, resulting in a tendency to obstruct small and medium-sized airways. The bronchial circulation can be explored indirectly in cardiac failure by the spirometric response to adrenergic agonists and antagonists administered by inhalation: bronchial vasomotor phenomena explain the symptomatology of cardiac asthma and also seem to play a role in the genesis of the dyspnoea of effort in patients with cardiac failure."
"The effect of adrenergic influences on Met-enkephalin concentrations in median eminence, neurointermediate pituitary and hypothalamus outside median eminence were examined. Met-enkephalin levels in median eminence were augmented by administration of the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist methoxamine acutely or chronically and decreased by the selective depletion of adrenergic transmitters by 6-hydroxydopamine. Met-enkephalin levels in neurointermediate lobe were decreased by methoxamine but unaffected by depletion of noradrenaline/adrenaline. These results indicate that adrenergic mechanisms maintain Met-enkephalin concentrations tonically in median eminence and deplete Met-enkephalin concentrations in neurointermediate lobe. These results suggest differential adrenergic regulation of hypothalamic proenkephalin neurons terminating in median eminence and neural lobe of pituitary."
"This study evaluated the effects of rat ANP(5-28) infusion into the blood-perfused dog gracilis muscle at concentrations ranging from 30 to 10,000 pg/ml. The vasculature of gracilis muscles from anesthetized beagle dogs was isolated and pump-perfused at constant flow with blood utilizing an extracorporeal circuit. Maximal vasodilatory capacity was determined by adenosine injection. ANP was infused into the arterial circuit to produce increasing arterial blood concentrations. Each infusion lasted 10 min. Systemic arterial pressure, central venous pressure, cardiac output and heart rate did not change during ANP infusion into the gracilis vasculature. ANP at arterial blood concentrations up to 10,000 pg/ml did not produce significant vasodilation although the vasculature showed pronounced vasodilation in response to adenosine. In vitro experiments showed that ANP had much less vasorelaxant activity in dog femoral artery and saphenous vein than in rabbit aorta. Therefore, rat ANP(5-28) at concentrations within and well above physiological and pharmacological ranges does not inhibit the basal vascular tone present in the innervated, blood-perfused dog gracilis muscle in situ."
"Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is reported to be the most powerful constrictor of blood vessels known. Atrial natriuretic factor is a potent relaxor of contracted vessels. This study examined the potential interaction between these vasoactive peptides on rabbit aortic rings. ET-1 contracted the rings in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 (-log M) of 9.78 +/- 0.16. Atriopeptin III (APIII) completely relaxed ET-1 (10(-9) M)-contracted rings with an EC50 of 9.63 +/- 0.07 and methoxamine contracted rings with an EC50 of 9.18 +/- 0.09. Pretreatment of aortic rings with APIII (up to 3 x 10(-6) M) did not alter the normal ET-1 dose-response curve with respect to potency but did diminish the maximal contraction achieved. An interesting additional finding was that the temporal nature of ET-1-induced contraction is remarkably dose-variable. In conclusion, the potent contractile effects of ET-1 on vascular smooth muscle can be effectively reversed but not prevented by APIII."
"1. Several alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists were examined for effects on spontaneous and stimulus-evoked release of [3H]noradrenaline from sympathetic nerves in guinea-pig vas deferens. 2. Prazosin (0.1 and 1 microM), phentolamine (30 microM) and yohimbine (10 microM) each enhanced the stimulus-evoked release of [3H]noradrenaline. 3. Prazosin and phentolamine increased the spontaneous outflow of [3H]noradrenaline, whereas yohimbine was without effect. 4. Methoxamine (10 microM) and clonidine (0.1 microM) inhibited the stimulus-evoked release of [3H]noradrenaline, whereas only methoxamine (1 microM) decreased the spontaneous outflow of [3H]noradrenaline. 5. The identity of prejunctional alpha-adrenoceptors in the guinea-pig vas deferens is discussed."
"The effects of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine (MTX) and the direct protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBU) on action potentials from guinea pig papillary muscles were studied. Measured with conventional microelectrodes, MTX (1 x 10(-7) to 3 x 10(-4) M) and PDBU (1 x 10(-9) to 1 x 10(-6) M) both caused a dose-dependent and reversible decrease in the action potential duration measured at 90\% repolarization (APD90) at 36.5 degrees C. The MTX-mediated response was blocked by both prazosin (3 x 10(-6) M) and phentolamine (1 x 10(-6) M) and mimicked by phenylephrine. Maximal concentrations of the two agents together resulted in only a partial (50\%) additive decrease in the APD90. At a lower temperature (27.5 degrees C), PDBU no longer produced a shortening in the APD90 and MTX produced a prolongation in the APD90. These results demonstrate that although alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation and PKC activation in guinea pig papillary muscle both lead to a decrease in the APD90, the differences in their effects as related to the magnitude, partial additivity, and temperature dependence suggest that the mechanism of action are not identical. These subtle differences may help to delineate the exact physiological implications of alpha 1-adrenoceptors in cardiac excitation and contraction."
"In conscious rats bearing venous and cerebroventricular cannulae, central administration of the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist methoxamine stimulated the secretion of ACTH, and the effect was reduced by the alpha 1-antagonist prazosin. Methoxamine was more potent in stimulating ACTH secretion when injected icv than peripherally, suggesting that the stimulant alpha 1-adrenoceptors are located in the brain rather than in the periphery. In order to investigate the relative roles of hypothalamic CRF-41 and vasopressin as mediators of the stimulant effects of alpha 1-adrenoceptors on ACTH secretion, we examined the effects of equipotent doses of antagonists to CRF-41 and vasopressin on the ACTH responses to methoxamine. The effect of methoxamine was reduced by the vasopressin antagonist dPTyr(Me) arginine vasopressin but not by the CRF-41 antagonist alpha-helical CRF-9-41, suggesting that vasopressin is more important than CRF-41 in mediating the effects of alpha 1-adrenoceptors on ACTH secretion. However, the combination of the two antagonists caused a reduction in the ACTH response to methoxamine that was greater than that of the vasopressin antagonist alone. This suggested that CRF-41 plays some role in this response, possibly by enhancing the activity of vasopressin in a synergistic manner. These two hypothalamic peptides seem to account for most of the ACTH releasing activity of alpha 1 adrenoceptor activation."
"Sumatriptan (GR43175) contracts rings of dog isolated saphenous vein by an action at 5-HT1-like receptors. We have now examined the effects of sumatriptan on prostaglandin E2(PGE2)-stimulated adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) accumulation in this tissue. Sumatriptan and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of PGE2-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation (EC50 values of 250 nM and 80 nM respectively), responses that were mimicked by 5-carboxamidotryptamine but not by U-46619 or methoxamine. The response to sumatriptan (1 microM) was antagonised by methiothepin (1 microM), but not by metergoline (0.1 microM), spiperone (1 microM) or ondansetron (GR38032, 1 microM). These results suggest that 5-HT1-like receptors which mediate contraction of the dog isolated saphenous vein are negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase in this preparation."
"In order to compare postreceptor mechanisms of different alpha adrenoceptors, polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis and extracellular calcium entry stimulated by alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor activation has been evaluated in the human digital artery, a tissue which contains both receptors. [3H]Inositol-I-PO4 accumulation during a 60-min exposure to an alpha-1 or alpha-2 agonist in the presence of 5 mM LiCl was used as an index of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis. Norepinephrine (1-30 microM) produced a concentration-related increase in [3H]inositol phosphate formation with an EC50 of 2.3 microM. Equieffective contractile concentrations of TL-99 (1 microM) and methoxamine (100 microM) produced similar increases in [3H]inositol-I-PO4 formation (1.41- and 1.70-fold increases over control, respectively). Norepinephrine EC50 values of 0.54, 1.7 and 1.0 microM were obtained for contractile responses in 1.25 mM Ca++, 0 mM Ca++ and 0 mM Ca++ + 0.1 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid, respectively. Calcium omission (no ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid) produced similar inhibition of alpha-2 and alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated responses, assessed as inhibition of the area under the concentration-effect curve. Calcium omission generally produced a slightly greater inhibition of TL-99- or methoxamine-induced contractile responses than did nifedipine (0.1 or 1 microM), but the combination of calcium-omission and nifedipine practically abolished the contractile responses. However, the combination of a calcium omission and nifedipine did not prevent the accumulation of inositol monophosphate stimulated by TL-99 or methoxamine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Phenylephrine produced concentration-related positive inotropic responses in isolated left atria and papillary muscles of guinea-pigs and rats. In rat tissues, these responses were unaffected by propranolol but antagonized by prazosin and therefore mediated via alpha 1-adrenoceptors. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine also exerted positive inotropic effects in these rat tissues. The maximum alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated effect of methoxamine (relative to the isoprenaline maximum) was greater than that of phenylephrine in left atria (in the presence of propranolol), whereas in papillary muscles phenylephrine exerted the greater maximum. In guinea-pig papillary muscles, the response to phenylephrine was unaffected by prazosin but was antagonized by propranolol and therefore caused by stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors. Methoxamine had no effect in guinea-pig papillary muscles. Guinea-pig left atria produced biphasic concentration-response curves for phenylephrine, the lower portion being antagonized by phentolamine and was therefore alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated, while the upper portion was antagonized by propranolol and therefore beta-adrenoceptor-mediated. Methoxamine exerted a small inotropic response, the maximum of which was similar to that of the first component of the phenylephrine response. Phenylephrine was a partial agonist for the cardiac beta-adrenoceptor. The density of rat ventricular alpha-adrenoceptors was 4 times greater than beta-adrenoceptor density, as measured by [3H]-prazosin and [3H]-dihydroalprenolol binding. This explains why the responses of rat papillary muscles were alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated. In contrast, the density of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites in guinea-pig ventricles was 6 times greater than the alpha-adrenoceptor density. This explains why the phenylephrine responses were beta-adrenoceptor-mediated in guinea-pig papillary muscles. In the left atria of guinea-pigs, which displayed both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor-mediated responses, the densities of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor binding sites were similar. Thus, phenylephrine exerts positive inotropic effects through alpha- or beta-adrenoceptors depending upon their relative densities."
"The role of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the neurotransmission of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-containing vasodilator nerves was investigated in perfused mesenteric vascular beds of the rat with active tone. NPY (5 and 10 nM) significantly inhibited the neurogenic vasodilation induced by perivascular nerve stimulation (1-8 Hz). However, NPY had no effect on vasodilation in response to bolus infusion of rat CGRP (10 and 100 pmol). These results suggest that NPY modulates the release of CGRP from CGRP-containing nerves in mesenteric resistance vessels."
"In slices of rat kidney cortex incubated in [3H]noradrenaline, the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine (10 microM), the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine (0.1 microM), as well as adenosine (10 microM), inhibited the electrical stimulation-induced (S-I) outflow of radioactivity, at a stimulation frequency of 1 Hz. Prior treatment of rats with pertussis toxin (25 micrograms/kg i.v.), which abolished the negative inotropic effect of carbachol (10 microM) on isolated atria, prevented the inhibition caused by methoxamine, but not that caused by clonidine or adenosine. At a stimulation frequency of 5 Hz, the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan (0.1 microM) and the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor indomethacin (10 microM) both facilitated the S-I outflow of radioactivity, and neither of these effects were altered by pertussis toxin. These results suggest that a pertussis toxin sensitive G-protein is involved in alpha 1-adrenoceptor inhibition of noradrenaline release, but not in alpha 2-adrenoceptor, adenosine or prostaglandin inhibition."
"A study was undertaken to investigate the reactivity of the circulation of bone and to pharmacologically characterize the receptor populations that may be present in this poorly described vascular bed. The nutrient artery of the tibia in skeletally mature mongrel dogs was cannulated, under direct vision, through a posterolateral operative approach. An extracorporeal circuit was established so that the nutrient artery of the tibia could be perfused in vivo under conditions of constant blood flow. Diverse vasoactive substances were injected into the perfusion circuit in small volumes as a bolus close to the nutrient artery of the tibia. A range of doses of nitroglycerin, acetylcholine, isoproterenol, methoxamine, U46619 (a thromboxane A2 mimic), dibutyryl cyclic AMP, 8-bromo-cyclic GMP, and endothelin-1 were injected in a randomized sequence for each experiment. The antagonists that were used were atropine (a non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist), ICI 118551 (a selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist), ONO 3708 (a prostaglandin H2/thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist), and prazosin (an alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist). The results of changes in bone-perfusion pressure under conditions of constant blood flow indicated that the vascular bed of bone actively responds to various vasoconstrictor mechanisms, whereas vasodilator mechanisms appear to be considerably less active. Intra-arterial injections of nitroglycerin, acetylcholine, and 8-bromo-cyclic GMP resulted in dose-related decreases in bone-perfusion pressure that were weak relative to concomitant changes in systemic arterial pressure. Intra-arterial administration of methoxamine, U46619, and endothelin-1 resulted in a potent dose-related increase in bone-perfusion pressure. The results of intra-arterial injections of isoproterenol and dibutyryl cyclic AMP were surprising; both substances caused a substantial rise in bone-perfusion pressure. The responses to acetylcholine, methoxamine, and U46619 were blocked in a competitive manner after administration of atropine, prazosin, and ONO 3708, respectively."
"Experiments were carried out on male white rats of Wistar strain, placed in metabolic cages in a room with artificial light and dark at 12-hour periods. Furosemide in a dose of 4 mg/kg was used intraperitoneally singly or after pretreatment with methoxamine in a dose of micrograms/kg or prazosin in a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. The renal excretory function was examined for a period of 2 hours. It was established that methoxamine usage increased diuresis without changing substantially sodium, potassium and total osmotic excretion. The application of furosemide after pretreatment with prazosin causes enhanced diuretic, sodium and chloruretic effect without potentiating potassium excretion. Separate examination of nephron functions by lithium clearance and its derivatives shows that alpha-adrenergic blockade reduces both proximal and distal resorption of water and sodium. The interaction of alpha-adrenergic agonist and alpha-adrenergic blocker affects chlorine excretion electively. After application of methoxamine the chloruresis, induced by furosemide, diminishes, but after prazosin pretreatment is increased."
"This experiment was designed to test further the hypothesis that vasopressin is the major mediator of the ACTH response to activation of central alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the rat. The alpha 1-adrenergic agonist methoxamine was given intracerebro-ventricularly to conscious vasopressin-deficient (homozygous Brattleboro) and normal rats bearing venous and intracerebro-ventricular cannulae. Methoxamine stimulated the secretion of ACTH in the normal, but not in the vasopressin-deficient, rats. The data confirm that vasopressin, rather than CRH-41 or oxytocin, is the major hypothalamic peptide that mediates the effects of central alpha 1-adrenoceptors on the pituitary corticotrophs."
"We investigated hemodynamic actions of endothelin (ET) in conscious rats. Intravenous injections of ET produced dose-dependent biphasic blood pressure (MAP) responses: initial decreases of up to 84 +/- 11 s were followed by increases of up to 1-h duration. Corresponding responses in cardiac output (CO), heart rate, and efferent splanchnic nerve activity were reciprocal to changes in MAP. Mesenteric blood flow showed an immediate and sustained decrease. Compared with equidepressor doses of sodium nitroprusside (NNP), ET produced a markedly different regional hemodynamic response pattern during the initial depressor phase. Compared with equipressor doses of the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine, ET produced significantly greater vasoconstriction in hindlimb and renal vascular bed during pressor phase. ET-induced changes in CO were significantly greater than the respective CO responses to NNP and methoxamine in intact animals and following cardiac autonomic blockade with atenolol and methscopolamine. ET has vasodilator and vasoconstrictor properties that induce a unique hemodynamic response pattern on intravenous injection. Persistence of ET-induced changes in CO following cardiac autonomic blockade suggests direct cardiostimulatory actions of the peptide during depressor phase as well as direct cardiodepressant actions during pressor phase."
"We studied changes in lung volumes and in bronchial response to methacholine chloride (MC) challenge when antishock trousers (AST) were inflated at venous occlusion pressure in healthy subjects in the standing posture, a maneuver known to shift blood toward lung vessels. On inflation of bladders isolated to lower limbs, lung volumes did not change but bronchial response to MC increased, as evidenced by a greater fall in the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) at the highest dose of MC used compared with control without AST inflation (delta FEV1 = 0.94 +/- 0.40 vs. 0.66 +/- 0.46 liter, P less than 0.001). Full inflation of AST, i.e., lower limb and abdominal bladder inflated, significantly reduced vital capacity (P less than 0.001), functional residual capacity (P less than 0.01), and FEV1 (P less than 0.01) and enhanced the bronchial response to MC challenge compared with partial AST inflation (delta FEV1 = 1.28 +/- 0.47 liter, P less than 0.05). Because there was no significant reduction of lung volumes on partial AST inflation, the enhanced bronchial response to MC cannot be explained solely by changes in base-line lung volumes. An alternative explanation might be a congestion and/or edema of the airway wall on AST inflation. Therefore, to investigate further the mechanism of the increased bronchial response to MC, we pretreated the subjects with the inhaled alpha 1-adrenergic agonist methoxamine, which has both direct bronchoconstrictor and bronchial vasoconstrictor effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"This study compares the effects of methoxamine, a pure alpha 1-agonist, and epinephrine on cerebral and myocardial blood flow, central hemodynamics, and survival in a randomized placebo-controlled fashion during prolonged ventricular fibrillation (VF) in a canine model. Twenty-four anesthetized and ventilated adult mongrel dogs were instrumented for regional blood flow determinations using radio-labeled microspheres. The dogs were randomized to receive either 20 mg of methoxamine as a single intravenous bolus or repeated boluses of 0.02 mg/kg of epinephrine, 0.2 mg/kg of epinephrine, or normal saline solution placebo beginning at three minutes following induction of VF and initiation of closed chest cardiac massage (CCCM). Organ blood flow measurements were determined during normal sinus rhythm and after five and 20 minutes of VF. All six dogs receiving methoxamine were successfully resuscitated in contrast to only one in each of the epinephrine-treated groups and none of the dogs receiving placebo (p less than .01). Although epinephrine was associated with significantly higher blood pressures than placebo during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), blood pressures achieved with methoxamine were significantly higher than those observed in the other three treatment groups (p less than .001). Cerebral blood flow was significantly higher with both methoxamine and high-dose epinephrine (p less than .05). Mean left and right ventricular myocardial flows were highest with methoxamine but this did not achieve statistical significance. In contrast, organ flows measured in the animals receiving the lowest dose of epinephrine were not significantly higher than those associated with placebo. Cardiac output after 20 minutes of CPR was significantly lower with high-dose epinephrine than with methoxamine or placebo (p less than .05). Our results suggest that methoxamine significantly improves regional cerebral blood flow and survival during CPR and although high-dose epinephrine is associated with comparable improvements in regional cerebral blood flow, this treatment is associated with deterioration in central hemodynamics during prolonged VF and does not enhance survival."
"All physiological feedback systems (e.g., in arterial pressure control) tend to oscillate in a characteristic manner. Mechanoreceptors can effectively buffer resulting fluctuations in arterial blood pressure. In this study arterial and cardiopulmonary receptors were interrupted in eight conscious foxhounds by sectioning the afferent pathways to the central nervous system. In response, three major peaks were detected in the blood pressure power spectrum: in addition to the well-known rhythms reflecting heart rate and respiration, very slow oscillating waves with a cycle length of 20 +/- 4 min and a 10(5)-fold higher power than the other two waves were detected. The amplitude of these oscillations could exceed 100 mmHg. This peak was also identified under control conditions (at a cycle length of 21 +/- 4 min, n = 6); however, the relative power was greater than 10(3)-fold less with mechanoreceptors intact (P less than 0.001). Thus a major slow oscillating component of arterial pressure control has been identified. Normally, mechanoreceptors buffer the resulting waves of this oscillator. These very strong fluctuations may characterize an important feature of blood pressure regulation."
"The role of sympathetic innervation in maintaining smooth muscle structure and function was investigated in the mature rat. Superior tarsal muscle volume, smooth muscle cell nuclear size and packing density, and alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated contractions were assessed in Sprague-Dawley rats at 3 months of age, and in rats at 6 months of age in which one muscle had intact sympathetic innervation and the contralateral mate was sympathectomized at 3 months. Body weight was stable between 3 and 6 months. In contrast, both maximum contraction and muscle volume increased by more than 50\% in the innervated organ, while chronic sympathectomy prevented these increases. Both nuclear packing density and nuclear size increased with age. The greater packing density was abolished by sympathectomy, but nuclear enlargement was not. Adrenoceptor supersensitivity was not observed, although the agonist dose producing 50\% maximum contraction varied as a function of contractile capacity. It is concluded that superior tarsal smooth muscle growth continues independently of changes in body weight in the mature rat. Structural and functional deficits observed following chronic sympathetic denervation of this muscle are attributable to prevention of growth rather than regressions in size and contractile capacity."
"The autoradiographic localization of [3H]prazosin (alpha 1-adrenoceptor ligand) binding sites was determined in cat spinal cord sections. High levels of [3H]prazosin binding were found in the intermediolateral cell column (IML) at thoracic and lumbar levels. The iontophoresis of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine onto sympathetic preganglionic neurones (SPNs) in anaesthetized cats and rats caused excitation of 8 cat SPNs and 13 rat SPNs. These results suggest an excitatory role for some of the catecholaminergic innervation of the IML."
"Extracellular single-unit recordings from neurons in the area postrema (AP) and the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in anesthetized male rats demonstrated that most cells in these regions have spontaneous activities of 5 Hz or less. Systemic angiotensin (ANG II) (50-500 ng) enhanced the activity of 55\% of AP cells tested (n = 76), whereas 53\% of tested NTS neurons (n = 62) were inhibited by ANG II. To determine whether these neurons were influenced specifically by circulating ANG II or by the accompanying increase in mean arterial blood pressure (BP), the effects of adrenergic agonists given intravenously on ANG II influenced neurons were also examined. Subsequently two cell types were characterized: cells responding to iv ANG II but not to the adrenergic agonist ("ANG II sensitive") and cells responding in a similar way to both agents ("BP sensitive"). Most ANG II-responsive neurons in the AP (53.5\%) and the NTS (65\%) were determined to be BP sensitive. These data demonstrate that ANG II influences the activity of AP neurons. In addition, there exists a second population of AP neurons apparently responsive to perturbations of the cardiovascular system. These studies further emphasize the potential roles of the AP in the regulation of body fluid balance."
"A controlled study of the cardiovascular responses in horses anesthetized with acepromazine (0.05 mg/kg of body weight, IV), guaifenesin (100 mg/kg, IV), thiamylal (5.0 mg/kg, IV), and halothane in O2 (1.2 to 1.4\% end-expired concentration) was performed to determine whether hypotension could be prevented by use of various treatments. Six horses were given 5 treatments in a randomized sequence: no treatment (control), methoxamine (0.04 mg/kg, IV), lactated Ringer solution (20.0 ml/kg, IV), 7.5\% hypertonic saline solution (4.0 ml/kg, IV), or constant infusion of dobutamine (5.0 mg/kg/min, IV) during anesthesia. Heart rate, ECG, blood pressure, central venous pressure, cardiac output, blood gas analysis, PVC, and plasma total protein concentration were measured during the study. Compared with the control value, an increase in blood pressure during halothane administration was observed after administration of lactated Ringer solution, hypertonic saline solution, or dobutamine (P less than 0.05). The improved blood pressure response to hypertonic saline solution and dobutamine was related to an increase in cardiac output, which was statistically significant (P less than 0.05). Other statistically significant differences in cardiopulmonary responses among treatments were not observed during anesthesia. The PCV was increased in response to dobutamine infusion, and plasma total protein concentration was reduced in response to administration of hypertonic saline or lactated Ringer solution."
"The purpose of the present study was to assess the possible sites which contribute to the nerve stimulation- and alpha-agonist-induced overflow of endogenous adenine nucleosides and nucleotides in vascular tissue. Particular attention was focused on the endothelium because it is known that endothelial cells have a high concentration of ATP and its metabolites. Segments of rabbit thoracic aorta, some denuded of endothelial cells by rubbing the lumen of the vessel, were incubated in organ baths and subjected to transmural nerve stimulation or stimulated with the alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine. A portion of the bathing solution was processed for the determination of norepinephrine by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection and a portion for determination of ATP, ADP, AMP and adenosine by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Transmural stimulation led to a significant release of both norepinephrine and the adenine nucleosides and nucleotides in a ratio of 1 to 350. Removal of the endothelium did not change the release of norepinephrine but reduced the release of adenosine and its derivatives by 90\%. Methoxamine also caused the release of adenosine and the adenine nucleotides which was reduced by 93\% by removal of the endothelium. Thus, the endothelium seems to be a major source of transmural nerve stimulation and alpha-agonist induced overflow of adenosine and adenine nucleotides. The endothelium is not the exclusive source of these purine congeners, however. In the case of transmural stimulation there is approximately 10\% of the total which is independent of the endothelium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Pharmacological characterization of adrenoceptors mediating smooth muscle contraction was performed in isolated preparations from the human uterine artery. The mixed alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, noradrenaline (NA) and the selective alpha 1-agonists, phenylephrine and methoxamine, all contracted the smooth muscle preparations in a concentration-dependent manner. The responses were antagonized competitively by the selective alpha 1-antagonist, prazosin, yielding pA2 values for the three agonists (8.33-9.08) typical for an interaction with alpha 1-receptors. The alpha 2-selective receptor agonists, clonidine and BHT 920, did not exert any contractile effects in the isolated uterine arteries, and the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist, yohimbine, counteracted the contractile effect of NA only at high concentrations. The concentration-response curve for NA was unaffected by the alpha 2-selective antagonists, rauwolscine and idazoxan. The results suggest that the postjunctional contractile receptors in the human uterine artery primarily are of the alpha 1 type, and give no evidence for any substantial involvement of alpha 2-receptors in this important tributary vessel of the human female reproductive tract."
"Although arginine vasopressin (AVP) is elevated in heart failure, inhibition of the vasopressinergic V1-receptor produces minimal changes in blood pressure. To determine whether the V1 vasoconstrictor effect is attenuated in heart failure, we randomly administered three increasing doses of AVP and methoxamine intravenously to 11 dogs with right-sided congestive heart failure (RHF) and 7 sham-operated dogs. Plasma AVP was elevated in RHF (21 +/- 3 pg/ml) compared with sham-operated dogs (3.8 +/- 0.6 pg/ml). While the pressor response to methoxamine was similar in the two groups, AVP caused a smaller increase in mean aortic pressure in RHF dogs than sham-operated dogs. To determine whether the difference in the pressor response to AVP was caused by greater reflex withdrawal of the sympathetic activity in RHF than sham-operated dogs, we also administered AVP after these animals had been pretreated with prazosin and propranolol. Adrenoceptor blockade exaggerated the pressor response to AVP; however, the increase in mean aortic pressure was still smaller in RHF than sham-operated dogs. The diminished pressor response in adrenoceptor-blocked RHF dogs was associated with a smaller increase in total peripheral vascular resistance compared with similarly treated sham dogs. Thus, although the pressor response to AVP was offset by baroreflex activation, the attenuated pressor effect of AVP in heart failure cannot be explained by sympathetic withdrawal alone. AVP probably exerts a smaller direct vasoconstrictor effect when the vasopressinergic system is chronically activated in heart failure."
"The vasodilatory effects of the synthetic rat atriopeptin (APII) have been studied in vitro in agonist-contracted, endothelium-denuded segments of the rat pulmonary artery, the ascending, and the distal abdominal aorta. In the pulmonary artery the contractures to methoxamine were inhibited more potently by APII (pD2 = 9.10 +/- 0.40, n = 6) than by the vasodilatory neuropeptide VIP (pD2 = 7.37 +/- 0.66, n = 6). The intrinsic activity of APII was 0.46 +/- 0.16 (n = 6). In segments previously exposed to either VIP or the beta 2-agonist salbutamol, APII was a near complete agonist (alpha = 0.82 +/- 0.17, n = 7 and 0.84 +/- 0.14, n = 6, respectively) without significant changes in the potencies. APII was a complete agonist also for the inhibition of the alpha-agonist-contracted segments of the aorta, however, with potencies 10-fold lower than in the pulmonary artery. VIP was without functionally significant effects in the aorta. The tachykinins (CGRP, SP, Neurokinins A and B) were without effects in all segments tested. In the ascending aorta, APII induced a long-lasting tachyphylaxis to the alpha-agonists, nearly completely abolishing the subsequent responsiveness to NA and methoxamine for more than 4 h."
"Quantification of intramyocardial hemorrhage was performed in 69 pigs submitted to various protocols of coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion. The study groups include 1) permanent occlusion; 2) reperfusion after periods of coronary occlusion of 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes; 3) reperfusion with diltiazem and with 4) methoxamine after a 60-minute occlusion period; and 5) permanent reocclusion after a 30-minute period of reperfusion. Red blood cell counts were directly assessed by visual examination of histologic slices of myocardium and in a subgroup of animals by counts of red blood cells labeled with 99m-technetium pertechnetate. Hemorrhage occurs in infarcts reperfused after a duration of 45 minutes or more of coronary occlusion and after a period of reperfusion maintained for at least 30 minutes. Red blood cell counts were maximal in the mid portions of transmural sections of the infarcts, with decreasing values toward epicardium and endocardium. Diltiazem decreased total red blood cell counts, whereas methoxamine increased it and also caused subendocardial hemorrhage. The most powerful predictors of the severity of hemorrhage after sustained reperfusion were infarct size and higher blood pressure."
"1. The cardiovascular effects of direct microinfusions of clonidine into the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) in rats of different ages were studied. 2. Clonidine microinfused into the NTS produced a dose-dependent hypotensive and bradycardic response, which was reduced by previous microinfusion of yohimbine but not of propranolol or prazosin. 3. Unilateral microinfusion of clonidine into the NTS produced a significantly smaller hypotensive and bradycardic response in 16 month old rats than in 3 month old rats, whereas in older animals (24 month old) the same doses of clonidine were ineffective. In 16 month old rats, yohimbine given into the NTS produced a smaller pressor and tachycardic response than in 3 month old rats whereas in 24 month old animals yohimbine, at the same doses, was unable to change blood pressure and heart rate. 4. Oral administration of phosphatidylserine (50 mg kg-1 day-1 for 30 consecutive days) enhanced the hypotensive and bradycardic response to clonidine microinfused into the NTS in 16 month old rats. The same schedule of treatment with phosphatidylserine did not affect the cardiovascular response to clonidine in young (3 month old) rats and did not restore responsiveness to clonidine in older rats (24 month old). 5. Methoxamine and phentolamine, given intravenously, produced similar pressor and depressor responses, respectively in 3, 16 and 24 month old rats, suggesting that the decreased sensitivity to clonidine in old rats was not due to peripheral cardiovascular changes. 6. In conclusion, the present results indicate that, during aging, there is a decreased sensitivity of alpha 2-adrenoceptors in the brain. Such an alteration can be reversed by chronic treatment with phosphatidylserine during the initial but not the later stages of aging."
"The role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-containing vasodilator nerves in maintenance of hypertension was investigated in the perfused mesenteric vascular beds isolated from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), deoxycorticosterone-salt-induced hypertensive rats (DOCA-Salt-HR) and corresponding normotensive control rats (Wistar Kyoto rats, WKY and Wistar rats, NR). In the mesenteric artery with an active tone, the neurogenic vasodilation induced by perivascular nerve stimulation (PNS, 0.5-8 Hz), which was mediated by CGRP nerves, was markedly decreased in adult SHR (15-week-old) when compared with age-matched WKY, whereas the vasodilation in DOCA-Salt-HR was similar in magnitude to that in NR. The vasodilator response to exogenously applied CGRP was greater in SHR than in WKY, whereas no difference was found between DOCA-Salt-HR and NR. The neurogenic release of CGRP-like immunoreactivity (CGRP-LI) induced by PNS of the mesenteric artery was significantly decreased in SHR compared to that of WKY. In addition, immunohistochemical studies showed decreased populations of CGRP-LI fibers in the mesenteric artery of SHR compared to those in WKY. These results suggest that CGRP-containing vasodilator innervation is greatly decreased in SHR with established hypertension. It is also suggested that the decreased vasodilator mechanism by CGRP-containing nerves contributes to the maintenance of hypertension."
"In this study we investigated the interaction of the sympathetic nervous system with renal perfusion pressure (RPP) in the short-term control of sodium excretion (UNa V). Pressure natriuresis curves (PNCs) were determined in 13 conscious dogs on a normal-salt diet during control conditions, bilateral common carotid occlusion (CCO), CCO combined with an intrarenal prazosin infusion, and during an intrarenal methoxamine infusion. RPP was reduced in controlled steps by inflation of a cuff placed around the renal artery. For controls, a reduction in RPP resulted in a strong decrease in urine output and UNaV. In all dogs, the PNC was closely related to individual resting blood pressure; UNaV fell to less than 50\% of control (10-20 mmHg below resting blood pressure). A baroreflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system by CCO shifted PNC to the right by 10-15 mmHg (n = 8). Sensitivity of pressure natriuresis was not affected by CCO. The shift was blocked when the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin was infused intrarenally during CCO (n = 9). Without CCO, prazosin had no effects on urine flow rate or UNaV at the control RPP. Similar to CCO, intrarenal infusion of the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine shifted PNC to the right by 15-20 mmHg (n = 4). Neither renal blood flow nor glomerular filtration rate was significantly different between control and any experimental condition. These results indicate that the sympathetic nervous system regulates UNaV by shifting the PNC through intrarenal alpha 1-adrenoceptors without altering the sensitivity of pressure natriuresis."
"We previously demonstrated that the mesenteric resistance blood vessels have nonadrenergic, noncholinergic vasodilator innervation in which calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a possible neurotransmitter. The role of CGRP-containing vasodilator nerves in hypertension was investigated in perfused mesenteric vascular beds isolated from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The adrenergic vasoconstrictor responses to perivascular nerve stimulation in both SHR (8-, 15-, and 30-week-old) and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat preparations increased with aging, but the response was greater in SHR than in WKY rats at all ages. The preparation isolated from SHR and WKY rats was precontracted by continuous perfusion of Krebs' solution containing 7 x 10(-6) M methoxamine plus 5 x 10(-6) M guanethidine. In both SHR and WKY rats, perivascular nerve stimulation (1-8 Hz) produced frequency-dependent vasodilation, which was blocked by 1 x 10(-7) M tetrodotoxin, pretreatment with 5 x 10(-7) M capsaicin, and denervation by cold storage (4 degrees C for 72 hours). The vasodilation induced by perivascular nerve stimulation in SHR greatly decreased with age, whereas a slight decrease in the response with age was found in WKY rats. The neurogenic vasodilation in the young SHR preparation was similar in magnitude to the vasodilation in age-matched WKY rats, whereas the vasodilation in 15- and 30-week-old SHR was significantly smaller than that in age-matched WKY rats. In both SHR and WKY rats, perfusion of rat CGRP (1 x 10(-10) to 3 x 10(-8) M) produced marked vasodilation in a concentration-dependent manner. The CGRP-induced vasodilation in SHR increased with age, whereas an age-related decrease in vasodilation was found in WKY rats. Perivascular nerve stimulation (4 and 8 Hz) of the perfused mesenteric vascular bed evoked an increased release of CGRP-like immunoreactive substance in the perfusate, which was significantly less in 15-week-old SHR than in age-matched WKY rats. Immunohistochemical studies showed an age-related decrease in CGRP-like immunoreactive fibers in SHR but not in WKY rats. These results suggest that CGRP-containing vasodilator innervation is greatly decreased when SHR develop and maintain hypertension. It is also suggested that the decreased vasodilator mechanism by CGRP-containing nerves contributes to the development and maintenance of hypertension."
"The mechanism of the vasodilator action of bunitrolol was investigated in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. When injected intraarterially, bunitrolol increased blood flow through the femoral arterial bed more effectively than that through the vascular bed of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). The former is rich in alpha-adrenoceptors and tonically controlled by the sympathetic nerves, whereas the latter is not. Intraarterial prazosin increased femoral flow but not LAD flow, whereas intraarterial nitrendipine increased equieffectively both femoral and LAD flows. In the saphenous arterial bed of dogs that also underwent spinal anesthesia and received atropine and nadolol, intravenous bunitrolol suppressed more effectively vasoconstrictor responses to saphenous nerve stimulation than those to intraarterial norepinephrine. These effects of bunitrolol were similar to those of prazosin and dissimilar to those of yohimbine. In similarly treated dogs, bunitrolol suppressed more effectively increases in mean systemic arterial pressure in response to methoxamine than those to B-HT 920. From these results, it was concluded that an alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking action is mainly involved in the acute vasodilator effect of bunitrolol. This action may also contribute to the decrease in total peripheral resistance seen in hypertensive patients treated chronically with bunitrolol."
"To investigate the mechanism by which alpha-adrenoceptor blocking drugs prevent ventricular arrhythmias associated with myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion, we studied the effects of alpha blockade, alpha-adrenoceptor agonists, and myocardial catecholamine depletion on arrhythmias and cellular electrophysiology during ischaemia and reperfusion in isolated perfused guinea pig hearts. Perfusion with phentolamine or indoramin significantly reduced ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) during ischaemia and reperfusion, and phentolamine was equally effective during reperfusion when added at the end of ischaemia. Both drugs prolonged action-potential duration (APD) and refractory period during ischaemia and reperfusion, and studies with phentolamine, in catecholamine-depleted hearts, indicated that its action was related to the presence of catecholamines. Myocardial catecholamine depletion also significantly reduced VT and VF during ischaemia and reperfusion. Perfusion with an alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, however, significantly reversed this antiarrhythmic effect, increasing the incidence of VT and VF during ischaemia and reperfusion. This arrhythmogenic effect was associated with a reduction in APD and refractory period, i.e., a reversal of the electrophysiological effects of catecholamine depletion. These results indicate that alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation is arrhythmogenic during myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion, and that the antiarrhythmic action of alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists is mediated via adrenergic rather than direct myocardial effects."
"The effect of Bay K 8644 on the contractile responses of the rat saphenous vein to KCl, noradrenaline, methoxamine, and B-HT 920 were studied. In all cases, Bay K 8644 potentiated the responses. These results confirmed the suggestion that alpha-adrenoceptor agonists initiated contraction in the rat saphenous vein by opening the potential-operated calcium channels."
"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) causes contraction of most large blood vessels and of venules. This is due mainly to direct activation of the smooth muscle or to amplification of the response to other neurohumoral mediators. Vasodilator responses to serotonin are seen mainly at the arteriolar level. They can be due to the release of other endogenous vasodilators, direct relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, inhibition of adrenergic neurotransmission, or release of an endothelium-dependent relaxing factor(s). Aggregating platelets release enough serotonin to evoke both constrictor and dilator responses. Hence the absence of endothelial cells or of adrenergic nerve activity may change the response to platelets from dilatation to constriction. Vasoconstrictor responses to serotonin released from aggregating platelets may play a role in the maintenance of the augmented peripheral resistance in hypertension. Such an involvement of serotonin is suggested by the following observations in humans and animals: the turnover rate of platelets is accelerated; the uptake of serotonin by platelets is reduced; the metabolism of serotonin by the endothelial cells is decreased; the vascular smooth muscles are hyperresponsive to the constrictor effects of serotonin and other serotonergic agonists; the S2-serotonergic antagonist ketanserin, which is devoid of agonistic properties, lowers arterial blood pressure in hypertensive humans. Whether the alpha-adrenergic blocking properties of ketanserin contribute to its antihypertensive properties in humans is still a matter of discussion."
"Ketanserin (120 mg/day) or placebo was given orally to 14 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension according to a double-blind crossover protocol, each treatment period lasting 6 weeks. Resting intraarterial pressure in the recumbent position was reduced from 150/84 to 141/77 mm Hg; the hypotensive effect persisted throughout an uninterrupted graded exercise test to the point of exhaustion. The hemodynamic effects were similar at rest and during exercise. Overall, systemic vascular resistance decreased by 14\%, heart rate fell by 5\%, but stroke volume and cardiac output increased. The pressor responses to methoxamine and to phenylephrine were reduced by ketanserin."
"alpha 1- And alpha 2-adrenoceptor mediated vasoconstriction were studied in 13 patients with essential hypertension and 13 age-matched normotensive controls. This was done by comparing the changes in forearm blood flow induced by intra-arterial infusion of the selective alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists methoxamine and B-HT 933, the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, and the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine in both study groups. The catecholamines were infused in the presence of propranolol in order to prevent beta-adrenergic effects. Forearm blood flow was measured by plethysmography. All agonists produced a dose-dependent vasoconstriction which was more pronounced in the hypertensive patients, although the difference was significant only for the infusion of the catecholamines and for the combined effects of methoxamine and B-HT 933. No preference was found for either the alpha 1- or alpha 2-adrenoceptor mediated vasoconstriction in the greater response of the hypertensive patients. These results could well be explained by structural vascular changes, secondary to the elevated blood pressure. No evidence was found for increased alpha 2-adrenoceptor mediated basal vascular tone in patients with essential hypertension, since yohimbine tended to induce a greater vasodilatation in the normotensive subjects."
"Potassium and alpha-receptor-stimulated contractile responses of caudal artery rings of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were measured under conditions in which norepinephrine (NE) uptake and K+-induced NE release by nerve terminals were eliminated. The maximum isometric tension developed by SHR arterial rings was significantly more compared with WKY arterial rings when arteries were stimulated with NE but not when stimulated with K+. The Ca2+ sensitivity of NE-stimulated arterial rings was about twofold higher compared with WKY arterial rings. However, the Ca2+ sensitivity of K+-depolarized arterial rings was comparable between WKY and SHR. This increase in Ca2+ sensitivity was specifically due to changes in the alpha 1-receptor-mediated mechanisms in SHR. The 50\% effective concentration (EC50) values for both NE and alpha 1-specific agonist, methoxamine hydrochloride, were comparable between WKY and SHR, suggesting that alpha 1-receptor sensitivity is not altered in SHR. The relative contributions of postsynaptic alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptors in caudal artery contractions as calculated from the experiments with alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptor agonist and antagonists were 80 and 20\% in WKY and 95 and 5\% in SHR, respectively. Nifedipine inhibition of caudal artery contractions was significantly greater (P less than 0.05) in SHR when stimulated with NE but not when stimulated with potassium. Our results indicate that the mechanisms involved in K+ depolarization-dependent contractions are not altered in SHR. However, the mechanisms involved in the coupling of alpha 1-adrenergic receptor and smooth muscle contractions may be altered in SHR caudal artery rings."
"The interaction between alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists was examined with respect to amylase release from rat parotid glands. The effect of hypothyroid status on this interaction was also compared with that in euthyroid rats. Both methoxamine and clonidine potentiated isoproterenol-induced amylase release from parotid glands of eu- and hypothyroid rats, but the alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated response disappeared in the hypothyroid rats. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP, a second messenger of beta-adrenergic agonists, also showed essentially the same results as those of isoproterenol, but potentiation of dibutyryl cyclic AMP-induced amylase release with alpha-adrenergic agonists was mediated through only alpha 1-adrenoceptors in both groups. Calcium ion plays an important role in the interaction between alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists. These results suggest that the potentiating effect of alpha-adrenergic agonists may be mediated at least in part through an unknown mechanism at the step distal to cyclic AMP formation in both eu- and hypothyroid rats."
"Postjunctional alpha-adrenoceptors subserve positive inotropic and chronotropic responses. When beta-adrenoceptors are blocked, agonists that act on alpha 1-adrenoceptors evoke positive chronotropic responses in the pithed rat and rat isolated atria. The rank order of potency for this effect is adrenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than phenylephrine greater than methoxamine. The order of potency for antagonists to block the responses is prazosin greater than phentolamine greater than yohimbine. Thus, the postjunctional alpha-adrenoceptors are of the alpha 1-subtype. The positive chronotropic responses elicited by activating alpha 1-adrenoceptors have a slower time course than those elicited by activation of beta-adrenoceptors. When beta-adrenoceptors are blocked by propranolol, the positive chronotropic response to phenylephrine is enhanced by increasing the calcium concentration or by the calcium channel activator Bay K 8644 (0.1 microM), whereas the response is decreased by lowering the calcium concentration or by calcium antagonists (verapamil, nifedipine, nicardipine and diltiazem). Therefore, the positive chronotropic response to alpha 1-adrenoceptor activation involves an increased influx of calcium through calcium channels. Prejunctional alpha 1-adrenoceptors are involved in autoinhibitory feedback regulation of transmitter release from noradrenergic neurones. In rat atria, the release of noradrenaline induced by sympathetic nerve stimulation is inhibited by both clonidine and methoxamine, and is enhanced (by disruption of noradrenaline-mediated autoinhibition) by both idazoxan and prazosin. Thus, the prejunctional alpha-adrenoceptors are of both alpha 1- and alpha 2-subtypes. Drugs which produce blockade of postjunctional alpha 1-adrenoceptors could also produce an increase in neurogenic release of noradrenaline due to blockade of prejunctional alpha 1-adrenoceptors, and this might result in more complex effects than would be anticipated."
"In strip preparations from the rabbit main pulmonary artery, it was not possible to differentiate convincingly between alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors, when selective agonists such as methoxamine, St 587, B-HT 920, and clonidine, as well as selective antagonists such as prazosin and yohimbine were used for receptor characterization. Measurements of the membrane potential of the vascular smooth-muscle cells with intracellular glass micropipettes showed similar depolarizations in response to the alpha 1-selective methoxamine and the alpha 2-selective B-HT 920. These observations suggest the occurrence of a uniform alpha-adrenoceptor population in the rabbit main pulmonary artery. However, in contrast to alpha 1-agonists, contractile responses to alpha 2-agonists differed considerably in their dependence on external Ca, as revealed in Ca withdrawal experiments, as well as by the use of Ca antagonists. Furthermore, inactivation of the guanine nucleotide-binding inhibitory protein (Ni protein) by pertussis toxin impaired vasoconstriction, in response to alpha 2-agonists, but left that to alpha 1-agonists unaffected. It is suggested that alpha 1- and alpha 2-agonists induce two distinct conformational changes in an otherwise uniform alpha-adrenoceptor of the rabbit main pulmonary artery. By the mediation of Ni protein, alpha 2-agonists appear to allow influx of Ca into the vascular muscle cells through a type of Ca channel that is unlikely to be controlled by voltage."
"Forskolin is a diterpene of the labdane family which activates adenylate cyclase. The effects of forskolin were investigated in a congestive heart failure (CHF) model that we newly established using anesthetized dogs. The model was made by the intramural injection of protease into the left ventricular free wall, saline loading, and dextran and methoxamine infusion. By this maneuver, aortic blood flow (AoBF) was decreased; left atrial pressure (LAP), systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and left ventricular endodiastolic pressure (LVEDP) were markedly increased; and systemic blood pressure was unchanged. A bolus injection of 5.0 micrograms/kg forskolin reversed the hemodynamic findings of CHF. It reduced LAP (17.5----7.9 mmHg) (mean, N = 7), SVR (19980----10390 dyne sec/cm5), time constant T (90.7----59.2 msec) and LVEDP (22.8----16.8 mmHg); and it increased Vmax (2.32----2.82 l/sec) and AoBF (0.50----0.72 l/min). Forskolin improved the CHF mainly through its vasodilator and positive inotropic actions."
"The influence of nisoldipine, a calcium entry antagonist, on vascular resistance and vasoconstrictor responses was investigated in the anesthetized cat. Nisoldipine, a dihydropyridine calcium entry blocking agent, decreased total peripheral resistance and dilated the intestinal vascular bed. This calcium antagonist blocked intestinal vasoconstrictor responses to BAY K 8644, a nifedipine analogue, which promotes calcium entry. The calcium entry antagonist decreased intestinal vasoconstrictor responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation, norepinephrine, and tyramine. Nisoldipine also reduced intestinal vasoconstrictor responses to potassium chloride and agonists that elicit vasoconstriction by specific receptor-mediated actions including stimulation of alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors. The vasodilator and inhibitory effects of nisoldipine on vasoconstrictor responses were reversible, and responses returned to control value over a 60-min period. The present data suggest that an extracellular source of calcium is required for maintenance of tone and for vasoconstriction induced by neuronally released or exogenous norepinephrine as well as a diverse group of agents that act through specific receptor mechanisms or depolarize vascular smooth muscle. The present results suggest that similar sources of calcium are required for vasoconstriction elicited by alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists in the feline intestinal vascular bed."
"When rat parotid explants were cultured on siliconized lens paper floating on chemically defined 199 medium, all of sialagogues tested increased ornithine decarboxylase activity, which was roughly proportional to the amylase released into the culture medium. S-Adenosylmethionine decarboxylase and DNA synthesis were also induced by isoproterenol, methoxamine, carbachol and pilocarpine, but not by serotonin or substance P. The increases of the two decarboxylase activities and DNA synthesis were observed in vivo in mouse parotid gland after repeated injections of carbachol or pilocarpine. These results indicate that both adrenergic and cholinergic sialagogues stimulate the syntheses of polyamines and DNA in murine parotid gland."
"The alpha-adrenoceptors that mediate contraction to exogenous and endogenous noradrenaline in rabbit isolated mesenteric artery were investigated. Prazosin (10(-9)-10(-7) M) antagonised contractions to noradrenaline, methoxamine, and, in particular, contractions to neuronal noradrenaline released by field stimulation. Only a high concentration (10(-5) M) of idazoxan was able to markedly antagonise the three contractile stimuli. The effects of idazoxan (at high concentrations) and prazosin were studied upon noradrenaline-evoked contractions attributable to intracellular Ca2+ release using Ca2+ -deplete medium, and, on readministration of Ca2+, upon Ca2+ influx. Both components of the response were inhibited by the two antagonists, but the contraction associated with intracellular Ca2+ release was preferentially inhibited in each case. The results demonstrate that only alpha 1-adrenoceptors are involved in the contraction of this tissue to exogenous and endogenous noradrenaline. This receptor type is linked to both extracellular and intracellular Ca2+ sources, although the latter is more sensitive to inhibition by alpha-adrenoceptor blocking drugs."
"The isometric tension development and 45Ca influx in response to norepinephrine (NE) and methoxamine stimulation were investigated in caudal arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar Kyoto normotensive rats (WKY). The maximum isometric tension developed as well as 45Ca influx in response to NE and methoxamine stimulation were significantly increased (p less than 0.05) in SHR caudal arteries as compared with WKY. On the other hand, neither the isometric tension developed nor the 45Ca influx in response to K+ depolarization were different between WKY and SHR caudal arteries. Estimation of [3H]prazosin binding to the membranes isolated from caudal artery of WKY and SHR showed a single class of high-affinity binding sites with Kd values for SHR 128 +/- 14 pM and for WKY 141 +/- 19 pM, and Bmax values for SHR 108 +/- 14 fmol/mg protein and for WKY 113 +/- 21 fmol/mg protein. From these results, we conclude: (a) Increased contractile response of SHR caudal artery rings to alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation appears at least in part to be due to an increased Ca2+ influx through receptor-operated Ca2+ channels; (b) the affinity or density of alpha 1-adrenoceptors estimated by [3H]prazosin binding is not altered in the SHR caudal artery."
"This study examined the influence of BAY K-8644, a dihydropyridine Ca2+ agonist, on the positive inotropic effects of strophanthidin, isoproterenol, methoxamine and extracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+0) in atrial muscle isolated from guinea pig heart. BAY K-8644 enhanced both the maximum developed tension observed in the presence of strophanthidin and the sensitivity to its toxic effects. The maximum contractile force observed in the presence of methoxamine was also elevated by BAY K-8644 pretreatment; however, the ED50 value for methoxamine was not affected. The maximum contractile force elicited by BAY K-8644 alone or by strophanthidin or methoxamine in combination with BAY K-8644 was approximately the same as that produced by isoproterenol alone. The Ca2+ agonist did not alter the maximum developed tension elicited by increasing concentrations of isoproterenol or Ca2+0; however, it reduce both the ED50 for Ca2+0 and the concentration of isoproterenol necessary to produce maximum contractility. These results suggest that combinations of BAY K-8644 and cardiac glycosides can elevate contractile force to a level greater than that produced by cardiac glycosides alone."
"Three classes of agonists associated with Ca2+-mobilization--alpha 1-adrenergic (methoxamine), muscarinic (carbachol) and peptidergic (substance P, SP)--significantly stimulated the secretion of mucin from enzymatically-dispersed rat submandibular gland acinar cells. The same three secretagogues also caused the hydrolysis of membrane inositol phospholipids, resulting in elevated cellular levels of inositol phosphates, particularly inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). Exogenous IP3 elicited the dose-dependent release of mucin in dispersed cells suggesting that agonist-generated endogenous IP3 may provoke a secretory response. IP3 and the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in combination, stimulated an additive secretion of mucin in the model. The potential use of these two agents as specific probes of the IP3- and diacylglycerol-associated legs of the polyphosphoinositide (PPI) breakdown pathway is indicated. Although all three agonists shared a common action in stimulating PPI hydrolysis, their effects on the beta-adrenergic mucosecretory response were inconsistent. A brief preincubation of cells with carbachol or SP significantly reduced the subsequent isoproterenol (IPR)-provoked secretion of mucin, whereas methoxamine plus IPR stimulated an additive response. The mechanisms underlying these opposite effects are not known. Failure of IP3 or TPA to modify IPR responses suggests that modulation of the beta response may operate at a locus before the generation of diacylglycerol and IP3, possibly at the level of signal transduction. The study indicates a role for Ca2+-mobilizing agonists in controlling submandibular mucin secretion and provides evidence that receptor-linked phosphoinositide hydrolysis is an early stage in their stimulus-secretion coupling mechanism."
"The effect of diabetes on vascular smooth muscle function was investigated in the muscular arteries from spontaneously and chemically induced diabetic rats. Isolated ring segments of superior mesenteric arteries from BB diabetic and streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats (12 weeks after onset of diabetes) were used for isometric tension studies. Contractile responses to alpha-adrenoceptor agonists (norepinephrine, methoxamine, phenylephrine, B-HT 920, guanabenz, SKF 89748-A), serotonin, and K+ were significantly higher in STZ-diabetic rat arteries as compared with the controls. In spontaneously diabetic rat arteries only the contractile responses to the putatively selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists, K+ and prostaglandin E1, were significantly increased. pD2 values of the agonists in both groups of diabetic arteries were not significantly different from the respective controls. Nifedipine inhibited all contractile responses in a dose-dependent fashion. The responses to K+ and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists were attenuated to a greater extent by nifedipine in both groups of diabetic blood vessels. The calcium channel activator, BAY K 8644, produced a twofold increase in force of contraction in streptozotocin-diabetic and spontaneously diabetic rat arteries as compared with the responses in their respective controls. These results suggest caution in extrapolating all the findings from the streptozocin-induced diabetic model to the spontaneously diabetic model. However, increased activity of calcium channels in vascular muscle cells in both groups of diabetics may be responsible, at least in part, for the increased vascular contractility in diabetes mellitus."
"1. Effects of Ca2+ agonist and antagonists on cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i)were studied using quin2. 2. Nicardipine (NIC), diltiazem (DIL) and verapamil (VER) had no effect on the rise in [Ca2+]i evoked by carbachol. Methoxamine-elevated [Ca2+]i was inhibited by VER but not by NIC and DIL. 3. All Ca2+ antagonists tested produced a decline of [Ca2+]i elevated by isoproterenol to the resting level. 4. The addition of 30 mM K+ gradually elevated [Ca2+]i in normal and Ca2+-free media, but it did not increase 45Ca2+ uptake into cells. BAY K 8644 did not increase [Ca2+]i. 5. We suggest that voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels are lacking and that at least 2 distinct receptor-operated Ca2+ channels exist in rat parotid cells."
"The present study was designed to assess in conscious normotensive rats the influence of various pressor agents on the acute blood pressure response to a bradykinin antagonist (B4162). This antagonist was used at a dose (400 micrograms i.v.) which had been previously shown to block the blood pressure lowering effect of exogenous bradykinin for several minutes. In control rats, the bradykinin antagonist had no effect on blood pressure. However, in rats pretreated with nonpressor doses of angiotensin II or methoxamine or with pressor doses of vasopressin or methoxamine, the same antagonist significantly increased blood pressure by 10 +/- 2.2, 12 +/- 2.7, 9 +/- 1.7, and 16 +/- 3.4 mm Hg, respectively. It therefore appears that circulating bradykinin is not directly involved in blood pressure regulation of conscious normotensive rats. Endogenous bradykinin may however play an important role in blood pressure control by attenuating the pressor effect of angiotensin II, vasopressin, and alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation."
"To evaluate the hypothesis of alpha-antagonism as a contributing factor to the vascular action of calcium entry blockade (CEB) in man, we have compared the action of verapamil, a CEB, on nonselective (norepinephrine, NE) and selective alpha 1-(methoxamine, MET) and alpha 2-(B-HT 933, BHT) adrenergic agonists in human forearm vasculature. All drugs were infused into the brachial artery at systemically ineffective rates. Blood pressure and heart rate were continuously monitored; forearm blood flow was measured through strain gauge plethysmography. Sixteen mild, untreated hypertensive patients were studied. Cumulative forearm blood flow dose-response curves to three cumulative infusion rates (3 min each) of NE (0.015, 0.05, 0.15 micrograms/100 ml tissue/min), MET (0.06, 0.6, 6 micrograms/100 ml tissue), and BHT (3, 10, 30 micrograms/100 ml tissue/min) were obtained during saline and after verapamil (0.9 micrograms/100 ml tissue/min X 15 min) infusion. Verapamil did not modify to any significant extent NE-mediated vasoconstriction, but clearly blunted the vascular action of either MET or BHT. Because NE is the physiological neurotransmitter, the data cast doubts about the relevance of alpha-antagonism as a mechanism of action of calcium entry blockade through verapamil. Besides, the data caution against generalizing by using data obtained through several compounds, including CEBs, of alpha-adrenergic stimuli."
"We tested the baroreflex in conscious, stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto controls (WKY) with incremental bolus injections of nitroprusside and methoxamine. The change in heart rate (HR) per change in mean blood pressure (MAP) was greater in WKY than in SHRSP. In contrast, the change in splanchnic nerve activity (SpNA) per change in MAP was greater in SHRSP than in WKY. The sympathetic outflow in SHRSP seems more reactive to blood pressure changes than in WKY. The discordance in HR and SpNA changes suggests that the integration of autonomic function in SHRSP is impaired."
"The vasoinhibitory effect of FR 46171, a new pyridine alcohol derivative, on contractile responses to alpha-adrenoceptor agonists was examined in isolated rabbit aorta. FR 46171 (10(-8)-10(-5) M) inhibited the maximum contractile response to clonidine (CL) in a concentration-dependent manner, but it only inhibited the responses to low concentrations of norepinephrine (NE) and methoxamine (MO). In the aorta pretreated with phenoxybenzamine, however, FR 46171 at 10(-5) M inhibited the residual maximum response to NE and MO. FR 46171 at 10(-5) M only inhibited the response to KCl (20 mM). FR 46171 at 10(-6) and 10(-5) M also moderately inhibited the response to added Ca2+ in a Ca2+-free medium in K+-depolarized preparations. Nifedipine at 10(-6) M, by contrast, nearly abolished the responses to potassium or added Ca2+. In a Ca2+-free medium with EGTA, an addition of NE (10(-5) M), MO (10(-5) M), or CL (10(-5) M) induced a phasic contraction. The inhibitory effect of FR 46171 (10(-8)-10(-5) M) was much greater on the response to CL than that to NE or MO. In a Ca2+-free medium with low EGTA and nifedipine (10(-6) M) in the presence of an alpha-adrenoceptor agonist (NE, MO, or CL), an addition of Ca2+ (2 mM) induced a tonic contraction. FR 46171 (10(-9)-10(-5) M) inhibited the Ca2+ response, which is activated by the agonists, in a concentration-dependent manner.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"The effects of lidocaine and procaine on contractile responses of isolated canine nasal mucosal blood vessels to field stimulation and methoxamine were investigated. Analysis of cumulative dose-response curves showed that the two local anesthetics antagonized methoxamine and inhibited the field-stimulation response. The latter effect was interpreted as due to the blockade of Na+ channels. This would inhibit nerve conduction induced by field stimulation. The former effect on methoxamine is probably caused by the effect of these anesthetics on the mobilization of Ca++ needed for smooth muscle contraction. Preincubation of the nasal mucosa with low doses of procaine or lidocaine shifts the methoxamine dose-response curve to the right. With higher doses, the maximal response is also reduced. The shift of the dose-response curve showed that procaine or lidocaine can change the alpha-adrenergic receptor affinity. Commercial 1\% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine also inhibits field stimulation and antagonizes methoxamine contractions. Lidocaine can increase the basal tone of nasal mucosa, while procaine cannot. From these results, we conclude that procaine and lidocaine have common mechanisms in blocking Na+ channels but differ in their ability to modify Ca++ stores or channels."
"The vascular effects of serotonin and the selective 5-HT2 antagonist ketanserin were investigated in the forearm of healthy subjects. The drugs were infused into the brachial artery in doses that did not elicit systemic hemodynamic effects (0.1-80 ng/kg/min for serotonin and 5-125 ng/kg/min for ketanserin). The interaction between serotonin and ketanserin was studied by combined infusions of serotonin with ketanserin, and the relative 5-HT2 and alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking potencies of ketanserin were studied by simultaneous infusions of the selective alpha 1-agonist methoxamine, the indirect sympathomimetic drug tyramine, and serotonin with two doses of ketanserin. Forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography. Heart rate and intra-arterial blood pressure were recorded continuously. All doses of serotonin induced an initial transient vasodilation that was followed by a steady vasodilation for the lower doses (0.1-10 ng/kg/min) and a steady vasoconstriction for the highest dose of serotonin (p less than 0.05). Ketanserin induced a dose-dependent vasodilation, which was significant from the dose of 15 ng/kg/min (p less than 0.05). The vasodilation induced by serotonin (1 ng/kg/min) was significantly enhanced by ketanserin, whereas the vasoconstriction elicited by serotonin of 80 ng/kg/min was reversed by ketanserin (p less than 0.05). The vasoconstriction induced by methoxamine and tyramine was attenuated at a lower dose of ketanserin than the vascular response induced by serotonin. It is concluded that serotonin acts mainly as a vasodilatator in healthy subjects, whereas only at very high doses is vasoconstriction mediated by 5-HT2 receptors observed. The vasodilation induced by ketanserin is most likely due to its alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking potencies."
"The vasoinhibitory action of nitroglycerin was examined on contractile responses to methoxamine and clonidine in isolated rabbit aorta. Nitroglycerin at 10(-5) M, but not 10(-6)-10(-8) M, shifted the concentration response curve for methoxamine to the right. Nitroglycerin (10(-8)-10(-5) M), however, noncompetitively inhibited responses to clonidine in a concentration dependent manner. Nitroglycerin (10(-5) M) had no effect on responses to potassium (10-70 mM), but slightly inhibited responses to Ca2+ (0.1-5 mM) in a Ca2+-free medium containing potassium. Nifedipine (10(-6) and 10(-5) M), however, almost abolished responses to both potassium and Ca2+ but had no effect on responses to either methoxamine or clonidine. Agonist-antagonist interactions using prazosin and yohimbine revealed that responses to both methoxamine and clonidine were due to activation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors. Results with phenoxybenzamine suggested that the aorta has more receptor reserve for methoxamine than for clonidine. Furthermore, in tissues pretreated with phenoxybenzamine, nitroglycerin (10(-5) M) inhibited the maximal contractile response to methoxamine (3 x 10(-4) M). The maximal response to clonidine in tissues pretreated with phenoxybenzamine was not affected by nitroglycerin (10(-8) M). Nitroglycerin (10(-9)-10(-4) M) had greater inhibitory effect on residual responses to clonidine (10(-5) M) than that to methoxamine (10(-5) M) in a Ca2+-free medium containing EGTA. The contractile responses to Ca2+ (2 mM) in a Ca2+-free medium containing EGTA, nifedipine, and either methoxamine (5 x 10(-7) M) or clonidine (3 x 10(-7) M) were inhibited by nitroglycerin (10(-9) - 10(-5) M). The effect of nitroglycerin was greater on responses in the presence of clonidine than methoxamine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"The alpha-adrenoceptor agonist ST-1059 (2-amino-1-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl) ethanol), the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine, the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine and a nonselective alpha-adrenoceptor agonist norepinephrine, all increase cardiac output and dose-dependently increase arterial blood pressure in spinally anesthetized ganglion-blocked dogs. The increase in cardiac output may be the result of an increased venous return via the contraction of capacitance vessels, and the vasopressor responses are attributed to an increase in total peripheral resistance. The increases in cardiac output and pressor responses induced by ST-1059 and methoxamine were antagonized by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (0.3 mg/kg i.v.), but those induced by clonidine were not inhibited. In contrast, the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (0.3 mg/kg i.v.) had little or no effects on the increase in cardiac output or the pressor responses induced by ST-1059 and methoxamine, but strongly attenuated those of clonidine. Prazosin and yohimbine inhibited the norepinephrine-induced increase in cardiac output and pressor responses. These results suggest that the increases in cardiac output and blood pressure induced by ST-1059 were mediated by postjunctional alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation, such as by methoxamine, but that those induced by clonidine were mediated by postjunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulation in dogs. Not only the postjunctional alpha 1-adrenoceptors but also the postjunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors may play an important role in the constriction of venous beds, as well as of the arterioles in spinally anesthetized ganglion-blocked dogs."
"The influence of nisoldipine, a dihydropyridine calcium entry antagonist, on vascular resistance and vasoconstrictor responses was investigated in the feline pulmonary vascular bed under conditions of controlled blood flow. The calcium channel blocking agent caused a small reduction in lobar vascular resistance and blocked pulmonary vasoconstrictor responses to BAY K 8644, an agent which promotes calcium entry. The calcium entry blocking agent also reduced pulmonary vasoconstrictor responses to methoxamine and to BHT 933, alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists, and to U 46619, an agent which mimics the actions of thromboxane A2. Although there was a marked difference in vasoconstrictor potency in the pulmonary vascular bed, responses to the thromboxane mimic and to the alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists were reduced by approximately the same extent. The increases in systemic arterial pressure in response to BAY K 8644, methoxamine, and BHT 933 were also reduced by nisoldipine, and the calcium entry antagonist reduced systemic arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance. The results of the present study suggest that an extracellular source of calcium is required for the maintenance of vascular tone and for the expression of vasoconstrictor responses, resulting from activation of alpha 1- and postjunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors and thromboxane receptors in the feline pulmonary vascular bed."
"The influence of age on the regional arterial and venous effects of serotonin (5-HT) was investigated in 13 young (aged 22-31 years) and seven older (aged 50-69 years) healthy volunteers. Single-dose infusions of 5-HT (1, 10, and 80 ng/kg/min) and of the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ritanserin (50, 150, and 500 ng/kg/min) were administered into the brachial artery. Subsequently, the relative arterial and venous effects of the highest dose of 5-HT were investigated. Forearm blood flow (FBF) and maximum venous outflow (MVO) were measured by venous occlusion plethysmography. Heart rate (HR) and intraarterial (i.a.) blood pressure were recorded semicontinuously. In both age groups, 5-HT induced an initial transient arterial dilation, followed by a persistent increase in FBF for the doses of 1 and 10 ng/kg/min and a relative small decrease in FBF for the highest dose. In both age groups, the highest dose of 5-HT induced a similar large reduction in MVO (p less than 0.05 for both). The reduction in MVO was attenuated by ritanserin (500 ng/kg/min, p less than 0.05 for both groups). In the younger subjects, this dose of ritanserin also unmasked an arterial dilator effect of the highest dose of 5-HT (p less than 0.05). The single infusions of ritanserin did not influence FBF significantly in either study group. No significant differences were observed between the age groups. These results show that in the forearm of healthy subjects arterial and venous vascular responses to 5-HT were not age-related. In the arterial vascular bed, 5-HT acted predominantly as a vasodilator; at high doses, mainly venous vasoconstriction was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Vascular smooth muscle function in rats with glycerol-induced acute renal failure (ARF) was investigated by recording both the contractile responses of portal vein segments and the relaxant responses depressed contractile responses to the alpha 1-agonist methoxamine, the alpha 2-agonist B-HT 920 and to the calcium agonist BAY K 8644 when compared with controls. Both isoprenaline and nitroprusside produced 100\% reversal of KCl induced tone in control aortic rings but in rings from rats with ARF complete reversal of of tone could not be obtained with either dilator drug. It is suggested that a defect in mitochondrial function and hence energy supply may account for the diminished ability of vascular preparations from rats with ARF to constrict and relax."
"The role of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors (adrenoceptors) on cardiac contractility was investigated in human subjects. The effect of methoxamine, a selective alpha-adrenoceptor agonist, and angiotensin II, on cardiac contractility was determined by means of noninvasive assessment of the slope of the end-systolic pressure (ESP)/end-systolic dimension (ESD) relationship. The slope (m) of this ratio was significantly higher with methoxamine (17.0; SD = 9.0 mm Hg/mm) than with angiotensin II (4.8; SD = 1.9 mm Hg/mm) (p less than 0.05). Slopes with methoxamine were higher when heart rates (HRs) were reflexly reduced, and were significantly diminished when reflex bradycardia was prevented by atropine (p less than 0.05) or atrial pacing (p less than 0.01). Previous treatment with propranolol did not modify m values with methoxamine (m = 15.5; SD = 4.4 mm Hg/mm). Phentolamine, given at peak methoxamine effect, did not consistently modify m values, resulting in an average slope not significantly different from that obtained with methoxamine alone. However, the addition of phentolamine did not cause an increase in ESDs at each level of ESP with respect to methoxamine. In the same subjects, infusion of phentolamine after angiotensin did not modify ESDs at comparable ESP levels. These findings suggest the existence of a positive inotropic effect mediated by alpha 1 adrenoceptors in the intact human heart."
"The effect of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine(NE) in stimulating the secretion of amylase from the parotid gland of rats was studied by use of selective alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonists. Its secretory response, mediated through beta-adrenoceptors, was slight during a short period of incubation, but rapidly increased after incubation for 10 min, showing a supersensitization phenomenon. Norepinephrine alone did not induce this phenomenon, but it induced the phenomenon in the presence of the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine or the alpha 1-antagonist prazosin. Isoproterenol-induced supersensitization was prevented by methoxamine. While, the accumulation of cyclic AMP in the tissue during incubation with isoproterenol and NE was not significantly affected by the presence of methoxamine and phentolamine, respectively. Phorbol dibutyrate did not inhibit the secretion induced by NE in the presence of phentolamine. These findings indicate that stimuli, mediated through alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors, induced secretion of amylase in parotid gland of the rat but that the alpha-effect inhibited the beta-effect when both stimuli were applied simultaneously and that the overall response of the tissue to NE resulted from the interaction of the two adrenoceptors."
"If a method produces a pressure contour with an arbitrary relative amplitude and without a base line, i.e. a pressure tracing without scale, and another method gives two out of the following three values: peak; bottom; and mean pressures, then we can obtain a pressure contour with a specified pressure scale. We can also obtain the value of the derivative of pressure with respect to time. If the curve of the ascending aortic diameter change closely resembles the pressure contour at the same portion (assumption 1), we can obtain the aortic pressure contour with an arbitrary pressure scale measuring the aortic diameter by a non-invasive ultrasonic method. The aortic peak systolic, end-diastolic and mean pressures can be measured by other non-invasive methods. Therefore, we can specify the pressure scale of the contour, and obtain the maximum derivative of the aortic pressure. If the maximum derivative of the left ventricular pressure (max dp/dt) can be substituted by that of the aortic pressure (assumption 2), we can obtain the former (max dp/dt) by non-invasive measurements only. We confirmed assumptions 1 and 2 by animal experiments, and showed the feasibility of non-invasive measurements of the left ventricular max (dp/dt) by interpreting the aortic diameter change curve as the pressure contour."
"1. Rat kidneys were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit solution and the perfusion pressure was monitored. After incubation with [3H]-noradrenaline the renal nerves were stimulated. The stimulation-induced (S-I) outflow of radioactivity was taken as an index of noradrenaline release. The effect of prostaglandins on perfusion pressure, pressor responses to renal nerve stimulation (RNS) and S-I outflow of radioactivity was assessed. 2. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2, 0.06 and 0.6 microM), PGF2 alpha (0.6 microM), PGI2 (0.6 and 3 microM) and iloprost (0.6 microM) increased perfusion pressure and enhanced pressor responses to RNS. These facilitatory effects of the prostaglandins were not a result of an enhanced transmitter release. In contrast, PGE2 dose-dependently inhibited, whereas the other prostaglandins failed to modulate S-I outflow of radioactivity. PGE2 (0.6 microM) also enhanced pressor responses to exogenous noradrenaline. 3. Arachidonic acid (1 microM) increased perfusion pressure and enhanced pressor responses to RNS. These effects were abolished in the presence of indomethacin (10 microM) suggesting that local production of prostaglandins from exogenous arachidonic acid was responsible for this facilitation. However, arachidonic acid (1 microM) did not modulate S-I outflow of radioactivity. Arachidonic acid (10 microM), despite causing a marked increase in perfusion pressure, failed to alter pressor responses to RNS and only slightly inhibited S-I outflow of radioactivity. 4. The thromboxane A2 (TxA2) receptor agonist U-46619 (0.1 microM) increased vascular tone and enhanced pressor responses to RNS. These effects were blocked by the newly developed selective TxA2 receptor antagonist, daltroban (BM 13505; 3 microM), suggesting that these facilitatory effects of U-46619 were due to activation of TxA2 receptors. However, U-46619 failed to alter the S-I outflow of radioactivity from rat isolated kidney. 5. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine (1 microM) also increased perfusion pressure and enhanced pressor responses to RNS without affecting the S-I outflow of radioactivity in the presence of the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor indomethacin (10 microM). 6. The results suggest that PGE2 modulates noradrenaline release through an inhibitory prejunctional receptor mechanism. There is no evidence for prejunctional PGF2 alpha, PGI2 or TxA2 receptors in the rat isolated kidney. All prostaglandins increased vascular tone in the rat isolated kidney and this alone may provide a condition for enhanced pressor responses to RNS since methoxamine also enhanced pressor responses to RNS without affecting S-I outflow of radioactivity. It is probable that postjunctionally active PGF2 and PGI2 is formed locally from exogenous arachidonic acid, but not enough prejunctionally active PGE2 is synthesized to modulate renal transmitter release."
"Previous studies have indicated that methoxamine (an alpha adrenergic receptor agonist) may provide an advantage compared to epinephrine (a mixed alpha and beta adrenergic agonist) during cardiac arrest and CPR. To test this theory, we compared the effects of bolus injections of epinephrine vs. methoxamine on survival, hemodynamic variables, blood gases, and blood lactate concentrations during ventricular fibrillation and CPR in 12 dogs. Each dog underwent a 3-min fibrillatory arrest followed by 10 min of fibrillation and CPR, at which time the animals were defibrillated. Epinephrine (0.05 mg/kg, n = 6) or methoxamine (2 mg/kg, n = 6) was administered at the start of CPR. Both epinephrine and methoxamine produced identical survival rates (5/6) with no differences in coronary perfusion pressure gradients or blood gases (aortic, venous, or great cardiac venous pH, PaO2, or PaCO2) during CPR. Also, there were no differences between the two study groups in myocardial lactate or oxygen extraction ratios during CPR. We conclude that in the dosages tested in our experimental model, epinephrine and methoxamine produce similar results in the variables which we measured."
"The author studied the histologic features of the intramyocardial arterioles of the dog, under various situations of vasomotricity induced by drugs. Hemodynamics were evaluated by the pressures of the right atria and the aorta and through the coronary flow. The histologic studies were done on biopsy specimens taken from the anterior left ventricular wall. The results were 1.1 (0.7-1.3) for the control state, 0.3 (0.1-0.6) for situations of vasodilatation and 1.5 (1.1-1.8) during vasoconstriction. The authors believe that the histologic appearance of the intramyocardial vessels, in the various situations of vasomotricity may represent the lower and upper limits of the autoregulatory curve."
"The characteristics of the glycoproteins contained in the secretory segments of the three major salivary glands of adult male rats and the secretion of these various glycoproteins in response to autonomic agents were examined by micro-disc electrophoresis. Characterization of the glycoproteins showed that the acinar segments from the three major salivary glands and the segments of the convoluted granular tubules from the submandibular gland each contain characteristic species of glycoproteins. The glycoproteins characteristic of the acinus of the submandibular gland were secreted into saliva in response to carbachol or dobutamine, those characteristic of the parotid gland by carbachol, methoxamine, or dobutamine, and those of the sublingual gland by carbachol, whereas glycoproteins characteristic of the convoluted granular tubules of the submandibular gland were only elicited by methoxamine. The secretory response of carbachol, methoxamine and dobutamine, respectively, were almost completely reduced by pretreatment with atropine, prazosin and metoprolol. The relative proportions of glycoproteins secreted into the oral cavity from secretory cells of the three major glands varied significantly with the nature of the stimulant."
"The changes in plasma level of alpha-atrial natriuretic polypeptide (alpha-ANP) and the relaxing responses to exogenous alpha-ANP of strips of rat aorta pretreated with methoxamine were examined at one, four and eight weeks after myocardial infarction induced by left coronary ligation. Responses to a beta-adrenergic stimulant, isoprenaline, and sodium nitroprusside of the vessel pretreated with high potassium were also evaluated up to twelve weeks. Plasma concentrations of immunoreactive alpha-ANP, which were measured at one, four and twelve weeks, were significantly elevated in rats with myocardial infarction (MI-rats) as compared with sham-operated rats (sham-rats). The relaxation responses of the aorta to exogenenous alpha-ANP in MI-rats were significantly reduced at one and four weeks as compared with sham-rats. The difference was, however, less obvious at eight weeks. The responses to isoprenaline tended to be reduced from the 1st week to the 12th week, and the difference was significant at eight weeks, whereas those to methoxamine and sodium nitroprusside were unchanged. It is concluded that the MI-rats are partially resistant to the vasodilating effects of alpha-ANP and isoprenaline without any change in responses to the alpha-stimulant and sodium nitroprusside, although these changes are transient."
"Factors mediating a regional difference in vasorelaxing effects of atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) were investigated, using the canine pulmonary and renal arteries. Isolated preparation was suspended in an organ bath, and the isometric tension was recorded. ANP relaxed both arteries dose-dependently under precontraction with methoxamine (3 x 10(-5) M). The maximum relaxation was extremely different between the two arteries: 78.5\% and 8.6\% of maximum relaxations caused by papaverine in the pulmonary and renal arteries, respectively. Removal of the endothelium affected neither the relaxation of pulmonary artery nor that of renal artery. Methylthionine (10(-5) M) greatly diminished the maximum relaxation in the pulmonary artery, but not in the renal artery, indicating that some free radical species may mediate the relaxation of pulmonary arteries to ANP. Methoxamine-induced contractions were inhibited by isosorbide dinitrate (10 and 30 nM) in both pulmonary and renal arteries, in a noncompetitive manner. Nifedipine (10 and 30 nM) inhibited the contractions competitively in the renal artery, but not in the pulmonary artery. Even in the Ca++-free solution, ANP diminished the methoxamine-induced contractions of the pulmonary arterial strips more effectively than those of the renal arterial strips. From these results, we concluded that the regional difference in the ANP-induced relaxation between the pulmonary and renal arteries was derived, partly, from a difference in the mechanism of intracellular Ca++ mobilization."
"We compared blood pressure, hindquarter vascular resistance properties, left ventricular weight, and norepinephrine kinetics, in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and weight-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats at 4, 9, 14, 20, 30, and 50 weeks of age. At 4 weeks, systolic and mean blood pressure measurements were the same in both strains, but the vascular resistance of the fully dilated hindquarter bed was significantly higher in SHR than in WKY rats, with a much larger difference during maximum constriction. Plots of resistance at maximum dilatation and at maximum constriction against body weight suggest that a component of the increase in vascular muscle mass in SHR occurred in the neonatal period preceding hypertension followed by a later component related to the rise in blood pressure. By contrast, left ventricular hypertrophy was minimal at 4 weeks and most of its development paralleled the rise in blood pressure. Sympathetic activity, assessed by norepinephrine fractional rate constant, was higher in SHR than in WKY rats in the left ventricle and kidney through most of the period between 4 and 50 weeks, but was similar in both strains in the muscle bed. This pattern of sympathetic activity will accentuate hypertension once cardiac and vascular hypertrophy are fully established. In all regions, norepinephrine tissue concentration was higher in young SHR and could potentiate the trophic effects of growth factors in early vascular hypertrophy. We suggest that the initial (primary) component of vascular hypertrophy precedes the rise in blood pressure and may be critical in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Possible reasons for the short delay in the rise in blood pressure in young SHR, once the vascular "amplifier" has been established, include high vascularity, immaturity of smooth muscle, and delay in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy."
"Verapamil is used clinically in the treatment of various cardiac diseases including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Its long term effects on ventricular mass are not well known. In 11 conscious dogs heart rate, aortic and left ventricular pressures, cardiac output, a methoxamine induced stress ventricular function test and left ventriculography were performed. These variables were measured prior to and following a mean 7.2 month infusion of verapamil at 0.005 or 0.01 mg.kg-1.min-1 using a subcutaneously implanted pump. Resting haemodynamic variables and left ventricular ejection fraction [60(SD 6) v 55(6)\%] were unchanged between baseline and chronic verapamil studies, but the slope of the methoxamine induced stress ventricular function test decreased from 3.9(0.8) to 2.1 (1.3). After verapamil was discontinued the mean slope of the stress ventricular function test returned to the baseline 4.0(1.7). Total ventricular weight increased 22\% from 176.1(17.5) g.m-2 in controls to 215.6(29.5) g.m-2 (p less than 0.01) in the verapamil animals. The right ventricular weight increased 25\% from 46(5.9) to 57.6(9.1) g.m-2 (p less than 0.01); the septum weight increased 26\% from 42.5(4.1) to 53.7(7.2) g.m-2 (p less than 0.001); and the left ventricular free wall weight increased 19\% from 87.4(9.8) to 103.9(15.7) g.m-2 (p less than 0.01). The increase in ventricular weights was not due to fibrosis or oedema since hydroxyproline contents and wet/dry ratios were not increased. In conclusion, a chronic infusion of verapamil in conscious dogs caused no change in resting haemodynamic variables but produced reversible depression of stress ventricular function and biventricular and septal hypertrophy."
"We have investigated systemically the hypothesis that there exist subtypes of the alpha-1 adrenoceptor in the canine pulmonary artery. The affinity of the alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, was assessed by Schild Regression Analysis against the agonists, phenylephrine, norepinephrine and methoxamine, in rings prepared from canine pulmonary artery using the classical technique in which control and treatment concentration-response curves are obtained in every tissue. This technique allows for appropriate corrections to be made in tissue-dependent differences in agonist potency, time-dependent changes in agonist sensitivity and differences in maximum responses that result from nonspecific effects of agonists occurring at higher concentrations, as was found to be the case for methoxamine. Two cumulative concentration-response curves were constructed for each agonist at 2-hr intervals, with the first (control) concentration-response curve being constructed before the addition of prazosin, and the second concentration-response curve obtained 1 hr after exposure to prazosin. Prazosin had similar pA2 values against phenylephrine (9.56), norepinephrine (9.32) and methoxamine (9.35), with slopes of the Schild Regressions not differing significantly from the theoretical value of unity, suggesting that blockade was competitive in all cases. The results provide no evidence for heterogeneity in alpha-1 adrenoceptors in canine pulmonary artery when assessed using the classical method involving two concentration-response curves in a single tissue and allowing for appropriate corrections in tissue-dependent differences and time-dependent changes in agonist response."
"To elucidate the pathogenesis of bronchospasm in congestive heart failure, we studied 23 patients with chronic impairment of left ventricular function due to coronary artery disease or dilated cardiomyopathy. In 21 of them we found marked bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine. The mean dose (+/- SD) of methacholine that elicited a 20 percent decrease in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 421 +/- 298 micrograms, nearly the same as in patients with symptomatic asthma. In contrast, there was no bronchial response to methacholine in 9 of 10 patients who had coronary artery disease but normal left ventricular function. Administration of the bronchodilator albuterol led to a partial (43 percent) reversal of the methacholine-induced bronchial obstruction. In 12 patients, pretreatment with the alpha-adrenergic agonist methoxamine (10 mg by inhalation), a potent vasoconstrictor, fully prevented the methacholine-induced decrease in FEV1. The protective effect of methoxamine was blocked by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine in all six patients who received this agent. We conclude that bronchial hyperresponsiveness to cholinergic agonists is frequent in patients with impaired left ventricular function and may contribute to the wheezy dyspnea commonly observed in such patients. The bronchoconstriction may be mediated at least in part by dilatation of the bronchial vessels."
"We investigated the influence of a stimulation of intrarenal alpha 1-adrenoceptors on the relationship between renin release and renal artery pressure in 8 conscious, chronically instrumented dogs receiving a normal salt diet. Renin stimulus-response curves were determined by a stepwise reduction of renal artery pressure down to 70 mm Hg (1) under control conditions, (2) during a bilateral common carotid occlusion combined with an intrarenal prazosin infusion, and (3) during an intrarenal methoxamine infusion. Both drug infusions did not alter resting renal blood flow. (1) The control renin stimulus-response curve revealed a flat portion (plateau-level) around and above the resting blood pressure and a very steep portion (slope) below a well-defined threshold pressure 10-15 mm Hg below the resting blood pressure. (2) An intrarenal alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade by prazosin prevented the resetting of the threshold pressure which is regularly observed during bilateral common carotid occlusion. (3) An intrarenal infusion of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine increased the threshold pressure. We suggest that the neural control of renin release within the autoregulatory range of renal blood flow involves two independent mechanisms: the direct release of renin from juxtaglomerular granular cells by beta 1-adrenoceptors, and the modulation of the threshold pressure of pressure-dependent renin release by intrarenal alpha 1-adrenoceptors. The small changes in renal nerve activity necessary to reset the threshold pressure and the close relationship between the threshold pressure and resting blood pressure imply an important function of intrarenal alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the regulation of renin release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"To test the hypothesis that the increase in locomotor activity and the diversification of stimulus sampling observed during intrahippocampal microinfusions of norepinephrine are mediated by beta adrenergic receptors, rats were infused with either the beta agonist isoproterenol or the alpha-1 agonist methoxamine while being tested in a Behavioral Pattern Monitor. The behavioral profile induced by isoproterenol was qualitatively similar to that observed previously with norepinephrine. Methoxamine had no significant effects. The ability of isoproterenol to mimic the norepinephrine-induced blockade of the hyperactivity associated with intrahippocampal microinfusions of the cholinergic agonist carbachol was also tested. Carbachol produced hyperactivity which was attenuated by the coinfusion of isoproterenol. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that increases in diversive exploration and stimulus sampling induced by intrahippocampal norepinephrine are due to the activation of beta adrenergic receptors within the dentate gyrus."
"We compared the effects of methoxamine on alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-mediated phosphorylase activation in rat hepatocytes and rabbit aorta. Although methoxamine is a potent agonist in activating phosphorylase of rabbit aorta, it had little effect in rat hepatocytes. Using the phenoxybenzamine inactivation method, we found that the quantitative relationship between 125I-BE2254 (125I-BE) binding capacity and maximal norepinephrine-stimulated phosphorylase activation was nonlinear in rabbit aorta, whereas it was linear in rat hepatocytes. The potency of methoxamine in inhibiting specific 125I-BE binding is significantly (p less than 0.05) higher in rabbit aorta (Kd, 96.4 +/- 7.7 microM), compared with rat hepatocytes (Kd, 283 +/- 16 microM). However, these quantitative differences could not fully explain the blunted [Ca2+]c and phosphorylase responses to methoxamine in rat hepatocytes. Treatment with chlorethylclonidine dose dependently suppressed 125I-BE binding sites and norepinephrine-induced phosphorylase activation in rat hepatocytes, whereas in rabbit aorta it resulted in only a 31\% decrease in 125I-BE binding sites, with little effect on phosphorylase activation. Furthermore, alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-mediated cellular events of phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis and phosphorylase activation were unaffected by the removal of extracellular Ca2+ in rat hepatocytes, whereas both responses were markedly attenuated in rabbit aorta. The results indicate that two different alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtypes activate glycogen phosphorylase, through different mechanisms for increasing [Ca2+]c in the two systems. In rat hepatocytes, alpha 1 receptors are closely linked to PI hydrolysis and Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and cause phosphorylase activation. In rabbit aorta, on the other hand, activation of alpha 1 receptors increases [Ca2+]c by Ca2+ influx from the extracellular fluid as well as by Ca2+ release, and both PI hydrolysis and phosphorylase activation are caused mainly by the Ca2+ entry. Methoxamine interacts with both chlorethylclonidine-sensitive and -insensitive alpha 1 receptor subtypes but selectively stimulates the alpha 1 receptor subtype that closely couples with the Ca2+ influx."
"The demonstration of abnormal beta-adrenergic and cAMP-modulated apical Cl- channels in cystic fibrosis (CF) airway epithelial cells suggests that other transporters, which are required for Cl- secretion, may also be abnormally regulated. A basolateral cotransporter was investigated by determining the initial rate of 36Cl efflux from cells isolated from CF nasal polyps or trachea and non-CF trachea. Cells were preequilibrated with radioactive tracer at 25 degrees C, and tracer transport was initiated by 10-fold dilution of an aliquot of cells in radioisotope-free medium. The initial rate of Cl transport was calculated from the linear portion of the efflux curves. In CF and non-CF cells, base-line Cl- transport was not blocked by furosemide but was stimulated twofold by l-epinephrine in Ca2+-deficient and Ca2+-replete transport medium. In both types of cells, furosemide blocked 70 and 77\%, respectively, of the stimulated Cl- transport. Prazosin, an alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, blocked the effects of l-epinephrine and methoxamine, an alpha 1-adrenergic agonist, stimulated prazosin- and furosemide-sensitive Cl transport. Ionomycin mimicked the effects of l-epinephrine. l-Isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, did not affect Cl transport. The results of this study indicate an alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation of furosemide-sensitive Cl transport in human airway epithelium that functions normally in CF airway epithelial cells. The transport mechanism is probably a Na-Cl or Na-K-2Cl cotransport located in the basolateral membrane and requires elevated intracellular Ca2+ for activation."
"We studied the function of the cardiac sympathetic nerve varicosity in isolated right atrial preparations of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats at 4, 9, 14, 20 and 50 weeks of age. Cumulative concentration-atrial period response (C-R) curves to isoprenaline showed similar maximum response and sensitivity (EC50) at all ages but there was an age-related fall in resting atrial rate. Similar results were found for methoxamine (alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist) although the maximum response was significantly less than for isoprenaline. The time-dependent recovery (T 1/2) of the fall in atrial period in response to sympathetic nerve stimulation from electrical field pulses (1-32 at 1 Hz) was enhanced by neuronal uptake inhibition by desipramine (0.1-1 mumol/l), to a similar degree at all ages. Pre-junctional alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulation by clonidine caused progressively more inhibition of the number of field pulses-fall in period relationship with age. SHR atria were similar to WKY rat atria at all ages except for a further impairment of the development of pre-junctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors. These studies indicate that the function of the cardiac sympathetic varicosity matures early (by 4 weeks) and overall there is very little impairment in SHR versus WKY rat atria."
"The role of postsynaptic adrenoceptors in the spontaneous activity of isolated bovine mesenteric lymphatic vessels was characterized. Low concentrations of noradrenaline (less than 10(-6) M) increased the amplitude and the frequency of the spontaneous contractions whereas high concentrations (less than 10(-6) M) depressed the activity. beta-Adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol enhanced the stimulation by noradrenaline and suppressed the inhibition. alpha 1-Blockade by prazosin or alpha 2-blockade by idazoxan antagonized the stimulation by noradrenaline and potentiated the inhibition. Activation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors by methoxamine, or of alpha 2-adrenoceptors by clonidine, stimulated lymphatic activity. The increases in the amplitude and frequency of the spontaneous contractions produced by each agonist were competitively antagonized by prazosin and idazoxan, respectively. Our results confirm the presence of postjunctional beta-, alpha 1-and alpha 2-adrenoceptors in lymphatic vessels and show that each of these receptors plays an important role in the adrenergic regulation of the spontaneous activity, with beta-adrenoceptors mediating inhibition, and alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors mediating stimulation."
"To elucidate mechanisms of angiotensin II (Ang II)-related hypertension, we infused angiotensin (76 ng/min s.c.) into rats with minipumps for 10-14 days. Control rats received sham pumps. We measured blood pressure by tail-cuff, and the excretion of aldosterone and prostaglandins (PG) (PGE2, prostacyclin derivative 6kPGF1 alpha, and thromboxane [Tx] derivative TxB2). Angiotensin II increased blood pressure by 20 mm Hg by day 2 and by 90 mm Hg by day 10. Aldosterone excretion increased from 10 to 70 ng/day in Ang II rats by day 7. Urine PGE2 did not increase in angiotensin rats; however, both 6kPGF1 alpha and TxB2 excretion increased with angiotensin. Control rats had no changes in any of these parameters. A sympathetic component was tested in a separate group of angiotensin rats that received phenoxybenzamine (300 micrograms/kg/day) during angiotensin infusion; their increase in blood pressure of 40 mm Hg at 10 days was less than in those rats with angiotensin alone but more than in control rats. Phenoxybenzamine did not influence the angiotensin-induced increases in excretion of 6kPGF1 alpha or TxB2. Additional groups of conscious angiotensin and control rats were equipped with splanchnic nerve electrodes on day 14 for recording of sympathetic nerve activity. Angiotensin rats had greater basal sympathetic nerve activity than the control rats. Incremental methoxamine injections demonstrated altered baroreceptor reflex function in rats receiving angiotensin. We conclude that increased blood pressure with chronic angiotensin infusion is accompanied by increased production of aldosterone and increased sympathetic tone. The latter may be modulated by PG."
"Slices of rat kidney cortex were incubated in [3H]noradrenaline, then placed in a flow cell and subjected to electrical field stimulation. At a stimulation frequency of 5 Hz, both the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan (0.1 microM) and the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (0.1 microM) significantly enhanced the stimulation-induced (S-I) outflow of radioactivity from the slice. However, neither clonidine (0.1 microM) nor methoxamine (10 microM), alpha 2- and alpha 1-agonists respectively, affected the S-I outflow of radioactivity at this stimulation frequency. At a lower stimulation frequency (1 Hz), the S-I outflow of radioactivity was not affected by idazoxan or prazosin, but was inhibited by both clonidine and methoxamine. The effect of clonidine was prevented by idazoxan (0.1 microM), but not by prazosin (0.1 microM). The effect of methoxamine was abolished by prazosin (0.1 microM), but not by idazoxan (0.1 microM). The inhibitory effect of methoxamine was not prevented by the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor indomethacin (10 microM) or the adenosine receptor antagonist 8-phenyltheophylline (1 microM) and thus was not mediated by either prostaglandins or adenosine. The results suggest that both prejunctional alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors are directly involved in modulation of noradrenaline release from the renal sympathetic nerves of the rat."
"Studies were made of the effects of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine on spontaneous and synaptically evoked activity in the solitary tract nucleus in isolated, perfused slices of the brain of the rat and those effects were compared to the effects of the alpha 2-agonist clonidine. Methoxamine had no effect on the spike activity of 7 out of 8 spontaneously firing neurones, with no response to electrical stimulation of the solitary tract. Among neurones that responded to tract stimulation, those which were otherwise silent (N = 38) showed a decrease of responsiveness to tract input during the infusion of methoxamine, whereas those with spontaneous activity (N = 10) showed mostly increases of both firing rate and responsiveness. The effects of activation of alpha 2-receptors on responsiveness to tract stimulation were the opposite of previously demonstrated effects of activation of alpha 2-receptors, and these opposing effects could be demonstrated in the same neurone. These results suggest that the transmission of visceral sensory information within the nucleus tractus solitarius may be controlled by opposing alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptor-mediated neural systems."
"The effect of chronic treatment (10 days) with thioridazine (25 mg/kg per day, i.p.) on the increase in diastolic blood pressure induced by methoxamine and xylazine was studied in the pithed rat. The dose-response curve for methoxamine, but not for xylazine, was shifted to the left by the neuroleptic. These results indicate that postjunctional alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the rat blood vessels become supersensitive after long-term treatment with thioridazine."
"In order to examine whether an aspiration mechanism exists in the vomeronasal organ (VNO) of the domestic ram, experiments were conducted in chloralose-anaesthetized animals using acute electromanometry and electrophysiological techniques. Stimulation of the ipsilateral cervical sympathetic nerve activated a mechanism producing a negative (with respect to atmospheric pressure) intraluminal pressure which drew fluid into the VNO from the nasopalatine canal. The mechanism was under alpha-adrenergic control and did not seem to involve the carotid blood supply. An ipsilateral increase in intraluminal pressure occurred following electrical excitation of the maxillary trigeminal innervation. Thus a mechanism was demonstrated in the ram for conveying odours to the putative olfactory receptors in the VNO."
"The effects of benextramine and nifedipine were examined on the dose-diastolic pressure response to methoxamine in pithed normotensive rats. Benextramine (3, 6 and 12 mg/Kg) displaced the dose-response curve to methoxamine to the right. Maximum response was reduced after the administration of 12 mg/Kg benextramine. Nifedipine (0.1 and 0.3 mg/Kg) also caused the dose-response curve to methoxamine to be displaced to the right with reduction in maximum response. Nifedipine effects were additive with an increase in the EC50 values as well as reduction in the maximum response after pretreatment with benextramine (3 and 6 mg/Kg). However, at the highest dose of benextramine the effects of nifedipine were diminished and no longer apparent. It is concluded that benextramine may have alkylated a nifedipine sensitive site on the alpha 1-adrenoceptors."
"Urinary diversion is the final therapeutic approach in several bladder pathologies including selected cases of bladder cancer, neurogenic bladder, and painful bladder syndrome. While there have been a few experimental studies on the effects of urinary diversion and subsequent undiversion on bladder capacity, the pharmacological changes occurring with diversion and undiversion have not yet been investigated. Our primary objectives were to determine the functional and pharmacological alterations in the defunctionalized bladder and the effects of refunctionalization on these changes. Thirty-two male adult canines weighing 15 to 20 lb. were used for this study. Three groups of dogs were urine diverted for one, three, and six month durations (four dogs per group). Another three groups of dogs were urine diverted for one, three, and six months (four dogs per group); these dogs were then undiverted for three months. Six control animals received either one or two sham operations at one, three, and six months. In all groups the functional and contractile characteristics of the bladders were assessed by urodynamics and in vitro contractile studies; bladder weight and muscarinic receptor density were also measured. Intravesical capacities determined by in vivo cystometry were reduced significantly to 74\%, 63\%, and 47\% of control values at one, three, and six months respectively after urinary diversion. Bladder capacity returned to above normal levels in bladders diverted and then subsequently undiverted. Similarly, the compliance and bladder weight of the diverted bladders were significantly less than control, while diverted bladders subsequently undiverted were similar to controls. Maximal bladder contractility in response to bethanechol stimulation was less in diverted bladders compared to control. This decrease in contractility was accompanied by a decrease in muscarinic receptor density. After undiversion maximal bladder contractility to bethanechol reached control levels; this was accompanied by a parallel increase in muscarinic receptor density to control values. There was no effect of diversion or undiversion on the maximal response of bladder strips to methoxamine stimulation. Thus, a bladder that has been diverted (defunctionalized) for a period of time showed decreases in capacity, compliance, and contractility to muscarinic stimulation along with a decrease in muscarinic receptor density. All of these parameters were restored after refunctionalization of the bladder."
"Effects of specific alpha-adrenoceptive agents (alpha 1-agonist, alpha 1-antagonist, alpha 2-agonist and alpha 2-antagonist) on the extraneuronal accumulation of 3H-isoproterenol in the perfused rat heart were examined. The extraneuronal accumulation of 3H-isoproterenol in the hearts perfused with 3H-isoproterenol (10(-6)M) under COMT inhibition by tropolone (10(-4)M) was about 6 times higher than that of intact COMT. The increase in the accumulation by COMT inhibition was regarded as 100\% and the effects of specific alpha-adrenoceptive agents on the accumulation was evaluated. alpha 1-agonists, methoxamine and phenylephrine, did not affect the accumulation. alpha 1-antagonists, prazosin, bunazosin and YM-12617, significantly decreased the accumulation of 3H-isoproterenol and these IC50 values were 2 x 10(-6)M, 3.5 x 10(-6)M and 2.3 x 10(-5)M, respectively. alpha 2-agonists, clonidine and guanabenz, significantly reduced the accumulation and these IC50 values were 3.4 x 10(-5)M and 2.9 x 10(-7)M, respectively. The alpha 2-antagonist, yohimbine, did not affect the accumulation. The present experiments clearly demonstrated that the tested alpha 1-antagonists and alpha 2-agonists inhibited uptake2 in rat heart but the tested alpha 1-agonists and an alpha 2-antagonist did not inhibit it."
"Hypothermia-induced potentiation of alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated responses of the mouse vas deferens to noradrenaline is mainly caused by inhibition of the sites of loss. However, even after blockade of the sites of loss for noradrenaline or when using methoxamine (which is not a substrate for uptake or metabolism) hypothermia still causes a significant increase in responsiveness. This remaining supersensitivity was shown to be an increased receptor affinity. Furthermore, hypothermia revealed contractile responses to low concentrations of UK 14304 (an alpha 2-agonist)."
"In the heart, alpha-adrenergic agonists have long been known to produce a positive inotropic effect that is rate dependent and associated with action potential prolongation but is not accompanied by adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) elevation. The ionic mechanism of these effects is unknown. We report that a transient outward K+ current, a major determinant of plateau duration in rabbit and human atria, is strongly inhibited by norepinephrine and the alpha-adrenoceptor agonists methoxamine and phenylephrine. These effects of alpha-stimulation can be blocked by prazosin. The reduction in the transient outward current substantially slows action potential repolarization. These results can explain the regional and species-dependent positive inotropic effects of alpha-adrenergic stimulation in the heart and give important new insight into the autonomic regulation of cardiac function. In addition, reduction in this repolarizing current during the enhanced alpha-adrenergic responsiveness of myocardial ischemia may be a factor in the genesis of arrhythmias produced by catecholamines."
"The modulatory influence of alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists on the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated or H2-receptor-mediated positive chronotropic effect was investigated in isolated guinea-pig right atria. In the presence of cirazoline, the isoprenaline- or impromidine-induced positive chronotropic effect was significantly reduced. Methoxamine also reduced the isoprenaline-induced positive chronotropic effect. The reduction was abolished by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. The protein kinase C activator phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, as well as the protein kinase inhibitor polymyxin B, had no influence on the cirazoline-evoked decrease of the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated positive chronotropic effect. Cirazoline, in the absence of isoprenaline or impromidine, concentration-dependently decreased heart rate, which could not be abolished by phentolamine and prazosin. Stimulation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors by phenylephrine in the presence of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist sotalol, decreased spontaneous heart rate. The decrease was abolished by prazosin as well as by pretreatment with the neurotoxin 6-hydroxy-dopamine. The decrease in heart rate may to some extent be the result of interactions at the level of signal transduction systems of the 3 receptors."
"Partial cystectomy is used clinically in specific circumstances. There have been some reports indicating that the bladder following subtotal cystectomy can regenerate to a certain degree. The present study investigates the physiology and pharmacology of bladder regeneration at eight weeks after resection of a major part of the bladder body in rabbits. The following studies were performed on control and cystectomy bladders: 1) in vivo cystometry (prior to and four weeks after the operation, and before the sacrifice at eight weeks); 2) sequential muscle strip study (the strips were obtained by dividing bladder transversely into upper body, lower body, mid-bladder, upper base and lower base); and 3) in vitro whole bladder studies. The results can be summarized as follows: 1) grossly there was no regeneration of the bladder body; the cystometric capacity was increased slowly after the operation primarily due to increased size and capacity of the bladder base. 2) The contractile response of the subtotal cystectomized bladder body to field stimulation and bethanechol stimulation was less than the response of normal bladder body. 3) The contractile response to epinephrine showed that the ratio of alpha/beta adrenergic response was much greater in the cystectomy bladder than in the normal bladder. 4) In the whole bladder study, the intravesical pressure response to field stimulation was about the same in both groups, the response to bethanechol was less for cystectomized bladder, and the response to methoxamine was greater for the cystectomized bladder. 5) The ability of cystectomy bladder to empty in response to both field stimulation and bethanechol was impaired whereas the control bladder fully emptied to both field stimulation and bethanechol. In conclusion, over the eight week period following subtotal cystectomy the capacity increased via distention (and hypertrophy) of the bladder base area as opposed to regeneration of the bladder body."
"Contractions were induced in rings of rabbit pulmonary artery with the preferential alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists, phenylephrine, methoxamine and St 587 [2-(2-chloro-trifluoromethyl-phenylimino)imidazolidine and the preferential alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists, clonidine and B-HT 920 [6-allyl-2-amino-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4H-thiazolo-(4,5-d) azepine] [corrected]. Phenylephrine and methoxamine acted as full agonists whereas St 587, clonidine and B-HT 920 were partial agonists (intrinsic activities 0.62, 0.38 and 0.42, respectively). Experiments with alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists indicated that the receptors involved are of the alpha 1 type only. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ inhibited maximal contractions to phenylephrine and methoxamine by 30\% and 49\%, respectively. The remaining contraction components of the full agonists were abolished by the "intracellular Ca2+ antagonist" TMB-8 [8-(N,N-diethylamino)octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate]. Contractions to St 587, clonidine and B-HT 920 were virtually abolished in Ca2+-free medium. Pretreatment of the donor rabbits with pertussis toxin (2.5 micrograms/kg i.v., 5-6 days before sacrifice) attenuated the efficacies of the full agonists, phenylephrine and methoxamine by only 24\% and 17\%, respectively, whereas maximal contractions to the partial agonists, St 587, clonidine and B-HT 920, were inhibited by 46\%, 61\% and 75\%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"The isolated anococcygeus muscle of the rat was used to study the effect of temperature on noradrenaline-induced contraction. The preparation was suspended in an organ bath containing Krebs bicarbonate solution for isometric tension recording. A decrease of the bath temperature from 37 degrees C to 20 degrees C (cooling) produced an increase in tissue sensitivity to noradrenaline, as reflected in a 5.37-fold leftward shift in the concentration-response curve, and increased the maximum contractile response to this agonist (14.3\%). Cooling had no effect on tissue sensitivity to a selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, methoxamine, but increased (12.4\%) the maximum contraction to a similar extent to that to noradrenaline. 6-Hydroxydopamine pretreatment or nortriptyline (1 mumol/l) induced a leftward shift of the noradrenaline concentration-response curve at 37 degrees C, and profoundly inhibited the potentiating effect of cooling on tissue sensitivity to the catecholamine; the effect of cooling on the maximum response was unaffected. The affinity of noradrenaline or methoxamine for alpha 1-adrenoceptors at 37 degrees C, determined from its dissociation constant (KA), was not significantly different from that at 20 degrees C. KA values were determined by use of irreversible antagonism with phenoxybenzamine. On the other hand, diltiazem at concentration of 3 mumol/l, which almost completely abolished the calcium ion-induced contraction of the potassium ion-depolarized muscle, caused only slight inhibition in the concentration-response curve for noradrenaline. The contractile responses to Ca2+ of the K+-depolarized muscle and of the tissue incubated in Ca2+ -free (EGTA 0.1 mmol/l) Krebs solution containing diltiazem and noradrenaline were both depressed by cooling.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"In pithed normotensive rats, the benzothiazolamine derivative R 56865 in high doses exhibits a competitive antagonism of alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstrictions. The absence of a depression of the maximum of the dose-response curve of ST 587 and the very moderate attenuation of the maximal B-HT 920-induced increase in diastolic blood pressure (BP) confirms the lack of major calcium entry blocking properties of R 56865 for alpha-adrenoceptor-activated calcium channels in vitro. In doses up to 10(-5) mol/kg, the interaction of R 56865 with the sympathetic neurotransmission can solely be explained by alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade. This was confirmed by the comparable antagonism of the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin in a concentration of 6 x 10(-8) mol/kg. In contrast to the isolated rat aorta, where R 56865 showed an allosteric interaction with the NA binding site on the alpha 1-adrenoceptor, R 56865 acts like an alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist of the competitive type in vivo."
"This paper reports the findings of phonocardiograms, echocardiogram and Doppler echocardiograms in a case of a 50-year-old man with early mitral valve prolapse with an early systolic murmur. A characteristic early systolic crescendo murmur was recorded at the apex. By amyl nitrite inhalation, the early systolic murmur was attenuated and a late systolic murmur was evoked. On the contrary, methoxamine injection increased the intensity of the early systolic murmur. Early systolic prolapse and early systolic buckling were recorded by two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiography. The phase of mitral regurgitation detected by M-mode color Dopper echocardiography coincided well in timing with the early systolic murmur and the early systolic buckling recorded on the M-mode echocardiogram. A discussion was made on the mechanism of the early systolic mitral regurgitation due to early mitral valve prolapse."
"The effect of methoxamine, an alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, on ischemic neuronal damage was studied in the gerbil. The animals were subjected to 5 min of ischemia by bilateral common carotid arteries occlusion. Morphological changes and calcium accumulation were evaluated in the CA1 sector of the hippocampus after 7 days of survival. The degree of ischemic neuronal damage and calcium accumulation in the methoxamine-treated groups were significantly attenuated compared with the saline-treated ischemic group. The results suggest that alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation prevents ischemic neuronal damage."
"We investigated the effect of repeated treatment with fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin uptake inhibitor, on behavioral effects of dopaminomimetics and methoxamine and on the animal behavior in the "behavioral despair" test. A repeated treatment with fluvoxamine (twice daily for 14 days) potentiated in mice and in rats (weaker) the amphetamine-induced hyperactivity. The hyperactivity induced by nomifensine in mice remained unaffected by fluvoxamine. The stimulation of locomotor activity by intracerebroventricularly administered methoxamine was not affected by repeated treatment with fluvoxamine. Given three times fluvoxamine had no effect on the immobilization time in the "behavioral despair" test in rats. The results indicate that fluvoxamine given repeatedly acts differently than citalopram, another selective serotonin uptake inhibitor, and differs also from other antidepressant drugs."
"The interaction between beta and alpha adrenergic agonists on regulation of cockerel aortic ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity was examined. The beta adrenergic agonist isoproterenol both reduced basal aortic ODC activity and prevented induction of the decarboxylase by the alpha adrenergic agonist methoxamine. 3-Isobutyl-1- methylxanthine (IBMX) similarly reduced basal ODC activity and blocked induction of the enzyme by methoxamine. When given ten minutes before or after methoxamine, isoproterenol prevented aortic ODC induction, but not large sustained increases in blood pressure evoked by the alpha adrenergic agonist. In contrast, when injected three hours after methoxamine, isoproterenol had no effect on already elevated levels of enzyme activity. Addition of isoproterenol (10(-7)M), IBMX (1 mM) or dibutyryl cAMP (2.5 mM) to isolated aortic segments cultured in minimal salts-glucose media evoked decreases in basal levels of ODC activity resembling those observed in the intact animal. These results suggest that the balance between alpha and beta adrenergic stimulation may be an important feature of the regulation of polyamine biosynthesis in artery wall cells."
"The role of trans-sarcolemma membrane electron efflux in the alpha-adrenergic control of Ca2+ influx in perfused rat heart was examined. Electron efflux was measured by monitoring the rate of reduction of extracellular ferricyanide and compared with changes in contractility, as an indirect assessment of changes in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration. Methoxamine and phenylephrine each increased the rate of ferricyanide reduction from 80 to approx. 114 nmol/min per g wet wt. of heart, with half-maximal activation occurring at 10 microM for each agonist. Activation of the rate of ferricyanide reduction by both 10 microM methoxamine and 10 microM phenylephrine was blocked by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phenoxybenzamine, but not by the beta-antagonist, propranolol. Stimulation of the rate of ferricyanide reduction by the alpha-agonist coincided with the increase in contractility, each reaching maximum values at approx. 80 s. Removal of the alpha-agonists led to parallel decreases in contractility and the rate of reduction, each returning to pre-stimulation values in approx. 400 s. In addition, the relationship between Ca2+ and ferricyanide reduction was examined. Perfusion of the heart with medium containing 6 mM CaCl2 significantly increased contractility and the rate of ferricyanide reduction. Perfusion of the heart with low Ca2+ diminished contractility, did not affect the rate of ferricyanide reduction, but amplified the stimulatory effect of methoxamine on this rate. The increase in ferricyanide reduction by alpha-adrenergic agonists resulted from a change in the apparent Vmax, indicative of an increase in electron efflux sites in the plasma membrane. It is concluded that alpha-adrenergic control of electron efflux closely parallels changes in contractility and therefore changes in the cytoplasmic concentration of Ca2+. The data suggest that alpha-agonist-mediated changes in electron efflux may lead to Ca2+ influx."
"The influence of changes in preload, afterload and contractile state on left ventricular (LV) filling characteristics were examined. Normal subjects underwent echocardiographic determination of the peak rates of LV dimension change and wall thinning and their respective timing at rest, after preload augmentation with dextran, during increased afterload with methoxamine and during inotropic stimulation by dobutamine. These 2 peak velocities and their timing in diastole correlated well with each other and responded similarly to interventions. Increased preload resulted in higher peak velocities of dimension change and wall thinning, without changing the time in diastole at which they occur. Both peak velocities moved later into diastole with higher afterload; however, the overall change in magnitude was variable and without statistical significance. Inotropic stimulation resulted in faster rates of peak dimension change and wall thinning, which occurred at an earlier point in diastole. Examination of various measures of LV size and function over a wide range of preload and afterload conditions under a constant contractile state revealed a complex set of relations. The ratio of wall thickness-to-dimension at end-diastole showed the most significant relation to the peak rate of dimension change, whereas peak thinning was best correlated with fractional wall thickening. Both velocities were also significantly but more weakly related to other variables of systolic function. The timing of these peak velocities correlated most closely with the end-systolic wall stress and heart rate. Thus, LV filling and wall thinning depend in a complex fashion on loading conditions, heart rate and contractile state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"The change in responsiveness to alpha-adrenergic stimulation and to calcium ions in amylase release from parotid glands of hypothyroid rats was compared with that in euthyroid rats. Calcium depletion and addition of verapamil or W-7 in the medium caused a decrease in methoxamine-induced amylase release in both eu- and hypothyroid rats. Moreover, addition of calcium ions to Ca2+-free medium markedly increased the methoxamine-induced amylase release in proportion to its concentration in hypothyroid rats. These results suggest that calcium ions play an important role in methoxamine-induced amylase release from parotid glands of hypothyroid rats as well as those of the euthyroid ones."
"We investigated the effect of cardiovascular depression on the pressor responses to the alpha 1-adrenoceptor selective agonist methoxamine, and the alpha 2-adrenoceptor selective agonist B-HT 920 in anesthetized ganglion-blocked rats. The calcium channel blocking drug nifedipine preferentially inhibited the effect of B-HT 920, as has been reported by other authors. Lowering the starting blood pressure by hemorrhage, by nitroprusside infusion, or by additional pentobarbitone also preferentially inhibited the pressor effect of B-HT 920. These selective effects of vascular depression on B-HT 920 are consistent with predicted interactions between functional antagonists and a partial (low-efficacy) agonist. This was tested in part by reducing the maximum effect of methoxamine by phenoxybenzamine treatment. Under these conditions, methoxamine behaved like B-HT 920 in that it was sensitive to inhibition by nitroprusside infusion. By analogy, the vasodepressive effect of calcium channel blocking drugs could be responsible for the preferential inhibition of the vasoconstrictor responses to alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists. It is concluded that a differential reliance on influx of extracellular Ca2+ by alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors may not be the only explanation of the selective effect of calcium channel blocking drugs."
"The role of calcium in the potentiation of amylase release by the alpha-adrenergic agonist methoxamine (MTX) was examined using dispersed rat parotid acinar cells. The stimulatory effect of MTX (10 microM) on the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (ISP, 1 microM)-induced amylase release was blocked by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine (10 microM). In Ca-free (1 mM EGTA) medium, the increment of amylase release by MTX in normal medium was decreased by about 70\%, but MTX still potentiated ISP-induced amylase release. MTX did not affect the cyclic AMP accumulation activated by ISP in either normal or Ca-free medium. MTX enhanced the ISP-stimulated uptake and efflux of 45Ca2+. These results suggest that both extracellular Ca2+ and intracellular stored Ca2+ may play an important role in the potentiation of amylase release from rat parotid acinar cells."
"Influence of endothelial cells on the effect of neuropeptide Y (NPY) was investigated. NPY (30 nM) doubled the vasoconstriction elicited by transmural nerve stimulation (8 pulses at 8 Hz) in the perfused rabbit ear artery with or without endothelium. Conditions that increase the biophase concentration of norepinephrine, longer stimulation trains or application of yohimbine, decreased the potentiation by NPY, although in the presence of cocaine potentiation by NPY was unchanged. However, no significant differences between control and endothelium-removed arteries were revealed. Thus modulation of adrenergic neurotransmission by NPY does not depend on endothelium-derived vasoactive substances."
"1. X-ray microangiographic techniques were used to study the influence of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) on vasomotion in the isolated, intact, buffer-perfused kidney of the rat. The main renal (R0), segmental (R1) and interlobar (R2) arteries (control diameters ca. 600, 400 and 300 microns respectively) were studied quantitatively. 2. Inhibition of basal EDRF activity by haemoglobin (1 microM) did not elevate perfusion pressure or constrict R0, R1 and R2 in control preparations, implying a low level of spontaneous myogenic tone. In preparations preconstricted by 0.3 microM methoxamine, haemoglobin caused a further rise in perfusion pressure and amplified constrictor responses in R1 and R2 while also inducing 'paradoxical' dilatation of R0. 3. A spatially heterogeneous pattern of diameter responses (constriction of R2 and R1 with minimal dilatation of R0) was observed with two concentrations of methoxamine (0.3 microM and 3 microM). The magnitude of these responses was, however, smaller with 3 microM than 0.3 microM methoxamine, even though it increased perfusion pressure to a greater extent (88 mmHg cf. 24 mmHg). This 'paradoxical' behaviour indicates more pronounced constriction of distal arteries (which could not be resolved quantitatively) with 3 microM methoxamine. 4. In contrast to the heterogeneity of constrictor responses induced by methoxamine, the dilator action of acetylcholine was spatially homogeneous: log IC50 values calculated from the diameter changes induced in R0, R1 and R2 were similar and, moreover, equivalent to that calculated from the corresponding alterations in perfusion pressure. The fall in perfusion pressure induced by an approximately median effective concentration of acetylcholine (0.3 microM) was completely reversed by haemoglobin, consistent with the involvement of EDRF, although, reversal of the acetylcholine-induced dilatation of R0, R1 and R2 was not observed. 5. The results are consistent with the idea that constriction of distal vessels can attenuate and even directionally reverse intrinsic constrictor responses in the proximal R0, RI and R2 'feed' arteries by producing an overriding increase in 'upstream' pressure. This effect explains the paradoxical dilatation of Ro induced by haemoglobin in the presence of 0.3 microM methoxamine, the smaller magnitude of the diameter changes induced in R0, RI and R2 by 3 microM as compared to 0.3 microM methoxamine, and the failure of haemoglobin to reverse the acetylcholine-induced dilatation of R0, R1 and R2."
"With coronary arteriography we examined the effect of acetylcholine (ACh) on large and small coronary arteries. ACh (12.5 to 200 micrograms) was injected into the right coronary arteries of 10 pigs during left ventricular pacing. The percentage of narrowing of the epicardial major coronary artery was used as an indicator of the constriction of the large coronary arteries, and the time required for the contrast medium to reach the posterior descending coronary artery from the ostium of the right coronary artery (blood-flow delay) was used as an indicator of the constriction of the same coronary arteries. A small dose of ACh (12.5 to 100 micrograms) induced mild narrowing (14 to 41\%) of the epicardial major coronary artery and a marked blood-flow delay of over 7.0 sec (control: less than or equal to 1.8 sec) in all 10 pigs. A large dose of ACh (100 to 200 micrograms) caused over 75\% narrowing of the epicardial major coronary artery and a marked blood-flow delay in 4 of the 10 pigs. When the marked blood-flow delay appeared, the perfused right ventricular myocardium became macroscopically anemic (ischemic). The constriction of large and small coronary arteries was not prevented by diphenhydramine (H1 blocker: 100 mg i.v.), but was prevented by pretreatment with atropine (1.0 mg i.v.). The intracoronary injection of histamine (1.5 mg) in 5 pigs constricted the epicardial major coronary artery over 75\% in 2 pigs, 50 to 75\% in 1 pig, and 25 to 50\% in 2 pigs, but there was no evidence of blood-flow delay. Neither methoxamine nor norepinephrine caused any significant coronary artery narrowing. The histology of the large and small coronary arteries was examined quantitatively with an image analyzer. The coronary artery showed no intimal thickening, and the endothelium was intact on light microscopic examination. The \% area of the smooth muscle layer (media) to the calculated total vascular area, and the ratio of the calculated medial thickness to the calculated inner radius (h/Ri) were 64 +/- 7\% (mean +/- SD) and 0.69 +/- 0.16, respectively, in the small coronary arteries less than 100 microns in external diameter, 47 +/- 9\% and 0.39 +/- 0.12 in the small coronary arteries 100 to 2000 microns in external diameter, and 34 +/- 4\% and 0.24 +/- 0.03 in the large right coronary arteries over 2000 microns in external diameter; the \% area of the media and the h/Ri showed a negative correlation with the size of the coronary arteries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
"Exogenously administered vasopressors (sympathomimetics) were evaluated in halothane-anesthetized dogs to determine the effects of these drugs on cardiovascular function before and after hemorrhage. Six dogs were anesthetized with thiamylal sodium (20 mg/kg of body weight) and halothane (1.25 minimal alveolar concentration) in 100\% oxygen. After instrumentation, cardiac output, systemic arterial blood pressure (SAP), heart rate (HR), left ventricular pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, and an index of cardiac contractility (dP/dT) were measured. Stroke volume, cardiac index (CI), stroke index (SI), rate-pressure product, and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were calculated. Epinephrine (0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 micrograms/kg/min [low, medium, and high doses, respectively]) and dobutamine (1, 5, and 10 micrograms/kg/min [low, medium, and high doses, respectively]) were infused. Methoxamine was given in a bolus of 0.22 mg/kg, IV. All measurements were taken at 2.5 minutes after infusion, and were repeated after removal of 40\% of the estimated blood volume. Dobutamine administered at the low dose before hemorrhage increased SAP and dP/dT. At the high and medium dose, dobutamine significantly increased CI, dP/dT, and SAP, with no significant change in HR or SVR. The medium dose of epinephrine was the most effective dose of epinephrine at increasing key variables (CI, SI, dP/dT). The response of CI and SI to this dose was not significantly different from the changes seen with high-dose administration of dobutamine. The dP/dT was significantly lower with epinephrine than with dobutamine, and SVR and HR were unchanged with epinephrine, except at the low dose, which decreased SVR."

Methoxamine was given in a bolus of 0.22 mg/kg, IV. All measurements were taken at 2.5 minutes after infusion, and were repeated after removal of 40\% of the estimated blood volume. Before hemorrhage, administration of high doses of dobutamine and medium and high doses of epinephrine were equally effective at increasing CI and SI. The dP/dT was increased to the greatest degree by administration of high doses of dobutamine. Administration of the low dose of dobutamine increased dP/dT, whereas administration of the low dose of epinephrine increased CI, HR, and SI, and decreased SVR. The HR and SVR were not increased by administration of any dose of dobutamine or of the medium and high doses of epinephrine. However, methoxamine increased SVR and decreased HR. Methoxamine decreased CI, SI, and dP/dT, but increased systemic arterial pressure to the same degree as that attributed to administration of high doses of dobutamine and epinephrine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Preparations of cauda epididymides were taken from rats unilaterally vasectomised by medial transection of the vas deferens. Responses of preparations from the operated side to field stimulation (10 pulses, 70 V, 1 ms, 0.1-20 Hz) declined in parallel with decreases in catecholamine fluorescence. There were leftward shifts in the mean cumulative concentration-response curves to noradrenaline on vasectomised cauda epididymides of 5-, 10-, and 12-fold at days 2, 7 and 28, respectively compared to unoperated cauda epididymides following vasectomy. Nisoxetine (0.1 mumol/l) enhanced the potency of noradrenaline upon unoperated but not upon vasectomised segments. There were leftward shifts of 7- and 8-fold in the mean cumulative concentration-response curves to acetylcholine in vasectomised cauda epididymides at days 2 and 7, respectively, following surgery. Responses to methoxamine and carbachol were unaffected by vasectomy. Thus neurotransmission to the smooth muscle of the rat cauda epididymis resembles that to the vas deferens, in that vasectomy results in the development of prejunctional supersensitivity to noradrenaline and acetylcholine."
"Experimental data suggest that a pure alpha-agonist, such as methoxamine, may improve the outcome of patients in ventricular fibrillation. A double-blind, randomized, prospective study was conducted in a paramedic system comparing the use of methoxamine with epinephrine in enhancing conversion of ventricular fibrillation while otherwise following American Heart Association protocols. One hundred two patients in ventricular fibrillation not responding to initial defibrillations with a pulsatile rhythm were randomized into one of two groups, each containing 51 patients. Equipressor doses of epinephrine (0.5 mg) and methoxamine (5 mg) were given intravenously and repeated according to American Heart Association guidelines. The mean age, sex ratio, and mean paramedic response times were comparable for the two groups. The mean time at scene until conversion was 22 +/- 10 minutes for methoxamine and 17 +/- 7 minutes for epinephrine (P = NS). The methoxamine group received 3.1 +/- 1.4 doses as compared with 2.8 +/- 1.3 doses for the epinephrine group (P = NS). Conversion rate, defined as the percentage of patients who developed a pulse during resuscitation, was 27.5\% for the methoxamine group and 49.0\% for the epinephrine group (P less than or equal to .03). Successful resuscitation, defined as the conveyance of a patient to an emergency department with a pulse and rhythm, was 17.7\% for the methoxamine group and 39.2\% for the epinephrine group (P less than or equal to .02). Save rate, defined as the percentage of patients discharged alive after hospitalization, was 7.8\% for the methoxamine group and 19.6\% for the epinephrine group (P less than or equal to .07).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"1. The effects of endothelin-1 and of three analogues in which alanyl residues had been substituted in place of cysteinyl residues were studied in the rat, isolated, Krebs-Henseleit-perfused mesenteric bed and the in situ, blood-perfused, mesenteric and hindquarters circulations of the rat. The effects on the vascular responses to these peptides of removing the endothelium by detergent perfusion or of cyclo-oxygenase inhibition by indomethacin were also determined. 2. In all three preparations, endothelin-1 was a potent vasoconstrictor (ED50 values ranged from 40 to 400 pmol) although it was rather less potent in the hindquarters than in the mesentery. Also, the maximum response was very much smaller in the isolated mesentery (24.7 +/- 2.1 mmHg) than in the in situ mesentery (81.8 +/- 2.6 mmHg) or hindquarters (107 +/- 10 mmHg). 3. Removal of the endothelium by perfusion with detergent significantly enhanced the potency of endothelin as a vasoconstrictor in the in situ messentery, but reduced the maximum response obtained, whereas removal of the endothelium in vitro significantly increased the maximum response without changing the ED50. The presence or absence of indomethacin had no significant effects in the blood-perfused hindquarters preparation or the isolated mesentery but, after administration of 5 mg kg-1 indomethacin to the in situ mesenteric preparation, the maximal response to endothelin-1 was enhanced. 4. When the preparations were preconstricted with alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists, endothelin-1 had modest vasodilator effects. These vasodilator effects were abolished when the endothelium was destroyed by detergent perfusion. 5. Both [Ala3,11]endothelin-1 and [Ala1,15]endothelin-1 were also vasoconstrictor agents in the mesenteric preparations but they were less potent than endothelin-1 itself; [Ala3,11]endothelin-1 was intermediate in potency between endothelin-1 and [Ala1,15]endothelin-1. In the in situ preparation these analogues gave similar maximal responses to the parent peptide but, in vitro, they gave maximal responses that were much greater than that of endothelin-1 and which were similar to those found with all 3 peptides in the in situ mesentery. Destruction of the endothelium in vitro had no effect on the responses to these 2 analogues and the log dose-response curve for [Ala1,15]endothelin-1 in the isolated mesentery was biphasic. 6. A third analogue possessing no disulphide bridges [( Ala1,3,11,15]endothelin-1) was a partial agonist in the in situ preparations but had no vasoconstrictor effect in the in vitro mesentery. It had no vasorelaxant effect in the hindquarters preparation but it enhanced the responses to endothelin-l when the 2 peptides were administered together in all 3 preparations. 7. It is concluded that it is not essential for the endothelin family of peptides to possess 2 disulphide bridges for them to be vasoconstrictor agents. However, only endothelin-1, of the 4. peptides studied, showed either endothelium-dependent vasorelaxant activity or modulation by the endothelium of its pressor effects. This, together with some differences in the vasoconstrictor log dose-response curves to the peptides and the results of co-administration of [Ala' 3'11"15]endothelin-1 and endothelin-1, suggests that there may be more than one receptor type mediating vascular responses to the peptides studied."
"The present study examined the changes in reactivity to a variety of vasoconstrictor drugs of the rabbit carotid artery during development of an intimal thickening induced by injury with an inflated balloon catheter. The injured and the unoperated contralateral carotid arteries were studied at 2 and 6 weeks after the operation. To differentiate areas of the injured artery lined by modified smooth muscle cells from areas lined by regenerated endothelial cells, each rabbit was injected with Evans blue dye before sacrifice. Ring segments (3 mm length) from the control and injured arteries were mounted in organ baths to record the circumferential isometric force with a technique that ensured that all rings were set to equivalent initial resting conditions of passive transmural stretch. Compared with the controls, the experimental arteries had a significantly decreased maximum contraction (Emax) in response to KCl at both 2 and 6 weeks. The experimental arteries were also significantly less sensitive to the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, methoxamine, at both 2 weeks (approximately sevenfold) and 6 weeks (fourfold), with a marked decrease in Emax at 2 weeks, which returned to control values at 6 weeks. There was no change in Emax to either serotonin or the thromboxane A2-mimetic, U46619, in the experimental arteries at either time. There was, however, a small but significant increase in the sensitivity to both drugs. There was no difference in response to any of the constrictor agents between the white and blue regions of the experimental vessels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Dobutamine (DOB), dopamine (DOP) and methoxamine (MEX) were compared as to their effectiveness in controlling circulatory depression caused by thoracic epidural anesthesia in dogs with instituted coronary stenosis. DOB appeared to best serve the purpose of reestablishing systemic circulation, notably with an elevation of blood pressure. DOP achieved the best restoration of the absolute value of regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF), but DOB and DOP both caused RMBF in stenosed and non-stenosed areas to increase to virtually the same extent, and furthermore, worsened the intramyocardial distribution of RMBF in stenosed area. With MEX, an alpha-stimulant, there was noted a significant increase in blood flow through a stenosed area and, moreover, the increment tended to be greater than in a non-stenosed area, a fact suggesting involvement of such a mechanism as reverse coronary steal."
"In halothane-nitrous oxide-anesthetized pigs, the effect of the competitive adenosine antagonist, BW-A1433U (a derivative of 1,3-dipropyl-8-phenylxanthine), on postdefibrillation bradyarrhythmia and hemodynamic depression was investigated. In protocol 1, repetitive episodes of ventricular fibrillation lasting 15 seconds before transthoracic DC shock were performed in five animals, before (control) and after the administration of BW-A1433U (5 mg/kg i.v.). An unsuccessful initial shock was immediately followed by a rescue shock of 40 A. In ventricular fibrillation episodes requiring rescue shocks, nine of 19 episodes (47\%) exhibited second- or third-degree atrioventricular block at 15 seconds postdefibrillation compared with only one of 16 BW-A1433U episodes (6\%). In protocol 2, the effect of BW-A1433U was determined in the presence of dipyridamole, a nucleoside uptake blocker known to potentiate the cardiac actions of adenosine. To counter the hypotensive effect of dipyridamole, methoxamine was continuously infused at 0.015 mg/kg/min i.v. Sequential episodes of ventricular fibrillation lasting 45 seconds were terminated by shocks of 40 A in the presence of methoxamine alone, after dipyridamole (1.5-7.5 mg i.v.), and after BW-A1433U (5 mg/kg i.v.). Over the first 15 seconds postdefibrillation, BW-A1433U significantly (p less than 0.05) increased the number of spontaneous beats (31 +/- 2) and systolic/diastolic blood pressure (111 +/- 4/67 +/- 5 mm Hg; mean +/- SEM; n = 9) compared with both methoxamine (16 +/- 2 beats; 98 +/- 14/52 +/- 12 mm Hg; n = 5) and dipyridamole (8 +/- 3 beats; 58 +/- 11/27 +/- 6 mm Hg; n = 9), respectively. Rapid infusion of BW-A1433U during dipyridamole postdefibrillation periods raised heart rate and blood pressure to preventricular fibrillation levels within 30 seconds. Thus, BW-A1433U can reverse and prevent postdefibrillation bradyarrhythmia and hemodynamic depression. Endogenous adenosine may be an important mediator of postdefibrillation cardiovascular collapse."
"Caffeine-norepinephrine interactions were studied in canine cardiac Purkinje fibers perfused in vitro. Caffeine (0.5-1 mM) or theophylline (0.5-1 mM) increased and then decreased contractile force in the absence and presence of 0.5-10 microM norepinephrine (NE) [in high extracellular calcium concentration ([Ca]o) caffeine only decreases force]. Occasionally, caffeine only decreased force in the presence of NE. In the presence of NE and 12 mM (sometimes even 4 mM) extracellular potassium concentration, caffeine did not decrease force below the precaffeine level. Reciprocally, in 0.5-2 mM caffeine NE increased force, although less than in the absence of caffeine. Even in 9 mM caffeine, NE increased force but slowed the final phase three repolarization of the action potential. Both NE and 8.1 mM [Ca]o increased force, but NE decreased force in the presence of high [Ca]o. In NE and propranolol (or propranolol alone), caffeine only increased force, whereas it had the usual effects in the presence of methoxamine or phenotolamine. In the presence of iodoacetic acid and 2-deoxy-D-glucose, NE caused contracture and caffeine exaggerated it. In contrast, in NE and 2 mM Mn, caffeine only increased force. It is concluded that initially NE diminishes the cytoplasmic calcium overload induced by caffeine (by promoting Ca uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum) and subsequently enhances it (by increasing the slow inward current)."
"To determine whether the slopes of the single beat maximal pressure (stress)/volume ratios are sensitive to changes in loading conditions in humans, 16 patients without cardiac disease were studied with simultaneous micromanometer-determined left ventricular pressures and biplane contrast cineangiograms under control conditions and during methoxamine and nitroprusside infusions. Left ventricular volumes were calculated with use of a Simpson's rule algorithm, wall thickness was obtained iteratively, and both midwall circumferential and meridional stresses were computed frame by frame. The maximal pressure/volume and both circumferential and meridional maximal stress/volume ratios were calculated using a single beat from each loading condition assuming a zero volume-axis intercept. Mean left ventricular systolic pressure increased 47\% during the methoxamine infusion and decreased 22\% during the nitroprusside infusion compared with control (p less than 0.001 for both). Despite these changes in left ventricular systolic pressure, heart rate was eliminated as a confounding variable by right atrial pacing; and mean maximal rate of change of left ventricular pressure [(+)dP/dtmax] and rate of change at developed pressure 40 mm Hg [(+)(dP/dt) per DP40] values did not differ significantly. Mean single beat maximal pressure/volume ratios also did not differ significantly among the three loading conditions. In contrast, mean single beat circumferential and meridional maximal stress/volume ratios were 3.15 +/- 1.83 and 1.40 +/- 0.82 g/cm2 per ml at control; they increased to 4.47 +/- 2.44 and 2.21 +/- 1.25 g/cm2 per ml during the methoxamine infusion (p less than 0.001 for both), and they decreased during the nitroprusside infusion to 2.58 +/- 1.47 and 1.14 +/- 0.57 g/cm2 per ml (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"1. We have examined the effects of a range of smooth muscle relaxants on the maintained contractions produced in rat aortic rings by the protein kinase C activator, 4 beta-phorbol dibutyrate; these effects were compared with those on the contraction induced by the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, methoxamine. The phorbol ester, at 0.3 microM, gave a sustained contraction which was, on average, of approximately the same magnitude as the maximum contraction produced by methoxamine, 10 microM. 2. The beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoprenaline (0.01-1 microM) caused a dose-related relaxation of the methoxamine-induced contraction but had no effect on the contraction induced by the phorbol ester. 3. An activator of adenylate cyclase, forskolin (0.01-1 microM) produced a dose-related relaxation of the methoxamine-induced contraction and at 0.01-10 microM caused relaxation of the contraction induced by the phorbol ester. Similar results were obtained with the potassium channel activator, cromakalim (0.001-10 microM). 4. An activator of guanylate cyclase, sodium nitroprusside (0.001-100 microM) caused a dose-related relaxation of both the methoxamine-induced and the phorbol ester-induced contraction, being more effective on the former than on the latter. Similar results were obtained with enprofylline (1-1000 microM). 5. Methoxamine (10 nM-100 microM), given cumulatively, caused a dose-related contractile response. Pretreatment with isoprenaline (1 microM), enprofylline (10 microM) and nicorandil (1 microM) resulted in partial decrease of the subsequent response to methoxamine, while nicorandil (10 microM), forskolin (1 microM), sodium nitroprusside (10 microM) and cromakalim (1 microM) totally abolished it. 6. The phorbol ester, given cumulatively, caused increasing contraction in the concentration range 30 nM-10 microM. Pretreatment with forskolin (1 microM), sodium nitroprusside (10 microM), isoprenaline (1 microM), enprofylline (10 microM), nicorandil (1 microM or 10 microM), or cromakalin (1 microM or 10 microM), resulted in partial decrease of the subsequent response to 4 beta-phorbol dibutyrate. 7. These results are discussed in the light of the suggestion that protein kinase C may have a role in the 'latch-bridge' phase of smooth muscle contraction, and that inappropriate activation of protein kinase C may contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension and other conditions involving vasospasm."
"In order to assess the role of the bronchial circulation in the pathogenesis of exercise-induced asthma (EIA), we conducted a double-blind, randomized study of the effects of pretreatment with an inhaled alpha 1-adrenergic agonist, methoxamine (Mx), in nine asthmatic teenagers with known EIA. Exercise consisted of 5 min cycle ergometry at a submaximal, constant work-load, while the subjects breathed dry air at ambient temperature. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was measured at baseline, 15 min after pretreatment of either Mx or saline, and serially after exercise. Mx significantly reduced the exercise-induced fall of FEV1 without modifying baseline FEV1 in five of the eight subjects, had little or no effect in three and caused an acute asthmatic attack in the remaining subject. Mx has potent constrictor effects on both bronchial and vascular smooth muscles through stimulation of postjunctional alpha 1-adrenoceptors. Therefore, the protective effect of Mx on EIA may be attributed to vasoconstriction of tracheobronchial vessels opposing the hyperaemia and mucosal airway oedema that may cause, at least in part, the exercise-induced acute bronchial obstruction in EIA. Alternatively, Mx stimulates mucus, water and electrolyte secretion by airway epithelium and may, therefore, oppose the dehydration of airway surface that could be a causative factor of EIA."
"To elucidate the effects of intravenous arginine vasopressin (AVP) on the neural control of the circulation, we investigated the action of AVP on neural circulatory control with respect to its influence on cardiac output (CO), mesenteric blood flow (MBF), and splanchnic nerve activity (SpNA) in conscious rats. We implanted Doppler flow probes and bipolar electrodes into seven Wistar rats for continuous monitoring of CO, MBF, and SpNa. After the infusion of four different equipressor doses of AVP and methoxamine, the decreases in heart rate (HR) and CO were significantly greater with AVP than with methoxamine. Pretreatment with atenolol and methscopolamine bromide abolished the decreases in HR after both AVP and methoxamine injections but attenuated the AVP-induced decreases in CO less than the methoxamine-induced CO decreases. In untreated rats and in rats receiving cardiac autonomic blockade, the reduction in MBF and the increases in mesenteric resistance were greater after AVP than after methoxamine. Furthermore, SpNA decreased to a greater extent with all doses of AVP than with methoxamine. We conclude that in the rat the exaggerated reduction in CO induced by circulating AVP is not because of a sensitization of neural mechanisms but rather to caridac actions of the peptide. In contrast, AVP sensitizes the sympathetic control of the mesenteric vascular bed to counterbalance its potent local vasoconstrictor effects."
"A model for the study of left ventricular (LV) contractility in a small species was developed using conscious rabbits previously instrumented with a LV catheter and ultrasonic crystals measuring LV internal diameter. Afterload increase produced by methoxamine infusion was associated with a reduction in heart rate from 272(SEM18) to 214(20) beats.min-1, p less than 0.01; and an increase in LV end systolic pressure from 76.3(4.1) to 101(6.5) mm Hg, p less than 0.001, and in end systolic diameter from 8.7(0.7) to 9.9(0.7) mm, p less than 0.01. For matched end systolic pressure and heart rate, the increase in inotropic state produced by noradrenaline infusion significantly shifted the pressure-diameter relation to the left. Similarly, end systolic pressure and diameter were significantly lowered by sodium nitroprusside infusion, with a reflex increase of heart rate; and a decrease in inotropic state produced by verapamil infusion was demonstrated by a significantly larger end systolic diameter for matched end systolic pressure and heart rate. The pressure-diameter relation was not modified by volume loading, which increased end diastolic diameter by 9.6(1.1)\% with no evidence of a Bainbridge reflex. The mild depressant effect of diltiazem was not detected by peak dP/dt changes but was demonstrated by the analysis of end systolic pressure-diameter relations. The instrumented rabbit thus appears to be a sensitive model for studying LV function and the cardiovascular effects of drugs."
"The side effects associated with recombinant interleukin 2 administration, including systemic hypotension and a vascular leak syndrome, may limit therapy before reaching maximum doses of this innovative and promising treatment for cancer. In an attempt to reverse this hypotension without decreasing cardiac output and systemic oxygen delivery (DO2), we studied several inotropic agents, dobutamine, dopamine, amrinone, CaCl2, and a pure alpha-adrenergic vasoconstrictor, methoxamine. These were administered singly or in combination to sheep with chronically implanted arterial and pulmonary artery catheters following 24 h of 3 x 10(5) units/kg recombinant interleukin 2. Compared to baseline values, 24 h of recombinant interleukin 2 infusion caused a significant increase in cardiac output from 4.4 +/- 0.9 (SD) to 5.0 +/- 0.6 liters/min, a significant fall in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) from 21 +/- 7 to 15 +/- 5 units, a decrease in mean systemic blood pressure (SBP) from 88 +/- 9 to 78 +/- 6 mm Hg, and a decrease in left ventricular stroke work from 51.5 +/- 8 to 49 +/- 6 gram meters (P less than 0.05) without any change in DO2. Dopamine, dobutamine, and CaCl2 returned SBP to baseline values by increasing cardiac output without increasing SVR. Methoxamine increased SBP by increasing SVR, but cardiac output decreased significantly. A combination of 12 micrograms/kg/min of dopamine and 2 to 3 mg of methoxamine infused over 15 min resulted in an increase in SBP, cardiac output, and SVR to baseline values while maintaining DO2 and oxygen consumption (VO2). We suggest that this latter combination would be appropriate for clinical use since it returns physiological parameters to normal."
"The effective period of isolated working guinea pig heart perfused with Tris-sodium-pyruvate solution (Tris-SP) was shown to be 70 min. Perfluorotributylamine at a concentration of 0.5\% added to Tris-SP prolonged the effective time to 90 min. 7-Bromoethyoxybenzene-tetrahydropalmatine (EBP) 10 mumol/L, and prazosin 0.1 mumol/L showed no obvious influence on the parameters in the isolated working guinea pig heart. Methoxamine 1 mumol/L and dopamine 1 mumol/L produced marked changes on LVP, ABF, +/- dp/dtmax and T-CO. It is suggested that the alpha 1-adrenoceptor was partially associated with the positive chronotropic action of the heart. Effects of methoxamine and dopamine on the parameters were antagonized by EBP. It shows that the antagonistic affects of EBP on methoxamine and dopamine are concerned with its antagonistic effect on alpha 1-adrenoceptor and dopamine receptor. This is consistent with previous results in rabbit aortic strips and rat anococcygeus muscles."
"Doppler echocardiographic measurements of blood flow velocity and acceleration in the ascending aorta have been shown to be useful descriptors of left ventricular (LV) systolic function. Few data exist, however, regarding the influence of loading conditions, particularly afterload, on these Doppler measurements in human subjects. Therefore, 14 normal volunteers (mean age 28 years) were studied using continuous wave Doppler echocardiography performed from the suprasternal notch both at baseline and during a controlled infusion of methoxamine. LV peak systolic (delta pk) and end-systolic (delta ES) wall stresses were calculated noninvasively using blood pressure and echocardiographic dimensions. Heart rate was kept constant by transesophageal atrial pacing. Methoxamine resulted in significant increases in mean systolic (163 +/- 8 vs 129 +/- 10 mm Hg) and diastolic (93 +/- 7 vs 71 +/- 12 mm Hg) blood pressure, as well as delta pk (277 +/- 25 vs 222 +/- 40 g/cm2 x 10(3] and delta ES (97 +/- 26 vs 77 +/- 19 g/cm2 x 10(3] (p less than or equal to 0.0004 for all). Conversely, peak velocity decreased from 0.91 +/- 0.18 m/s at baseline to 0.8 +/- 0.18 m/s (p less than or equal to 0.002) and peak acceleration decreased from 22 +/- 5 m/s2 at baseline to 19 +/- 5 m/s2 (p less than or equal to 0.006) during methoxamine infusion. Flow velocity integral and LV end-diastolic dimension remained unchanged. Thus, aortic flow velocity and peak acceleration are inversely related to afterload. This relation should be considered when using serial determinations of these Doppler parameters for patients in whom changing levels of afterload might occur."
"A denervated heart coupled to a periphery previously exposed to high catecholamine levels provides a unique model to study adrenoceptor physiology. Six orthotopic transplant patients (1.3 +/- 0.8 years postoperative) were age matched with six atropine-treated normal subjects. Simultaneous two-dimensionally targeted left ventricular echo-cardiograms and calibrated carotid pulse tracings were recorded. Left ventricular contractility was assessed with use of heart rate- and load-independent end-systolic indexes. Studies were performed at baseline and during dobutamine infusion with and without beta-adrenergic blockade with use of propranolol; effects were assessed during afterload changes generated by the alpha 1 agonist methoxamine. There were no differences in baseline contractility or reserve between transplant patients and normal subjects. The heart rate response to dobutamine was greater for transplant patients (p less than 0.001). In both groups, the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of dobutamine were ablated by propranolol. Dobutamine plus propranolol (unopposed alpha 1 effect) did not change mean systemic pressure in transplant patients while markedly raising mean systemic pressures in normal subjects (36 +/- 18 mm Hg; p less than 0.001). In addition, during initial challenge with methoxamine, the transplant patients required 60\% more alpha 1 agonist than did the normal subjects (p less than 0.001) to obtain a pressor effect. In summary, transplant patients who were previously in severe heart failure have normal left ventricular inotropic response to beta 1 activation and blockade, exaggerated chronotropic response to dobutamine and reduced sensitivity to stimulation with alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists. These findings are consistent with a differential response of adrenoceptors to long-term stimulation after cardiac transplantation."
"The end-systolic pressure-volume relation is employed to evaluate left ventricular contractility. In clinical studies, pharmacologic vasoconstriction is used to increase left ventricular systolic pressure to assess pressure-volume relations. However, the effect of vasoconstrictors on the ventricular contractile state is not well characterized. The effects of methoxamine and phenylephrine on systemic arterial pressure and left ventricular contractility in rabbits were studied with three protocols. In protocol 1, anesthetized rabbits (n = 10) were injected with incremental doses of methoxamine and phenylephrine intravenously. Methoxamine (4 mg) increased the mean arterial pressure by 50 +/- 12\% (mean +/- SE) (n = 5, p = 0.001). Phenylephrine (0.2 mg) increased mean arterial pressure by 82 +/- 14\% (n = 5, p = 0.004). In protocol 2, isolated blood-perfused hearts were injected with incremental doses of these drugs in the ascending aorta in amounts approximately equal to the concentrations injected in the intact rabbits. Methoxamine (2 mg) reduced isovolumic peak systolic left ventricular pressure by 43 +/- 9\% (n = 7, p = 0.003), whereas phenylephrine (0.1 mg) increased the isovolumic pressure by 24 +/- 9\% (n = 7, p less than 0.05). These responses indicated an enhanced contractile state with phenylephrine and a reduced contractile state with methoxamine. Pretreatment with propranolol blunted the effect of phenylephrine on isovolumic pressure (n = 6, p less than 0.02). In protocol 3, cross-circulation experiments allowed study of the effect of these drugs on isovolumic left ventricular pressure in the isolated heart and simultaneously on the systemic arterial pressure in the intact anesthetized rabbit (support rabbit).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"This study compared the hemodynamic effects of verapamil with other interventions that alter loading conditions in canines. The close correlation between peak filling velocity and systolic excursion indicated that peak filling velocity was dependent on systolic performance. However, verapamil caused a significantly greater increase in peak filling velocity than nitroprusside or volume loading despite a comparable increase in systolic excursion. Although both verapamil and volume loading induced increases in the peak filling velocity, the end-diastolic pressure and the peak pressure of the atrial v-wave, the pressure at the nadir of the atrial y-wave fell after verapamil but rose after volume loading. The rate of y-descent was also significantly greater after verapamil than after volume loading. These results indicate that, in addition to a reduction in afterload and an increase in preload, verapamil has a direct beneficial effect on ventricular filling."
"Alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptor responsiveness and binding have been examined in cardiac tissues removed from guinea-pigs pretreated with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) for 3 weeks. Results were compared with control tissues from sham-injected animals. Chemical sympathectomy with 6-OHDA resulted in an increase in the sensitivity of postjunctional beta-adrenoceptor-mediated responses to isoprenaline. No such increase was observed for the alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated responses to methoxamine. The increase in beta-adrenergic responsiveness was accompanied by a significant (P less than 0.05) 52\% increase in the number of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol binding sites with no change in binding affinity. [3H]-Prazosin binding was not affected by pretreatment with 6-OHDA. The results suggest that cardiac beta- but not alpha 1-adrenergic responsiveness is regulated by the sympathetic innervation."
"Food ingestion stimulates cortisol secretion in man, but the mechanism of this effect is unknown. We have investigated the possible role of adrenoceptors in the mediation of this effect. Six normal males were given continuous 3 h i.v. infusions of normal saline, methoxamine (alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist) and thymoxamine (alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist). Methoxamine enhanced and thymoxamine attenuated the ACTH and cortisol responses to a standard meal given 60 min after commencement of the infusion. The drugs had no effect on nutrient absorption. Four patients with recent onset of pituitary ACTH deficiency and normally responsive adrenal glands showed no ACTH or cortisol rises after the standard meal, demonstrating that postprandial cortisol secretion is mediated by pituitary rather than gut ACTH. Our previous investigations have demonstrated that alpha-1 adrenoceptors stimulate pituitary ACTH secretion in man by an action within the blood brain barrier. We therefore conclude that postprandial cortisol secretion is mediated by central stimulant alpha-1 adrenoceptors modulating pituitary ACTH secretion."
"Prolonged exposure to noradrenaline (NA) brings about an increase in the release of prostaglandin (PG)-like material from rat aortic strip. The release is greater with oxymetazoline while methoxamine decreases it. These effects are blocked by yohimbine and prazosin respectively. Pretreatment with 6-OHDA or reserpine diminishes the release of PG-like material. Barium chloride, a non-specific spasmogen, does not affect the release significantly. It appears therefore that the source of PG-like material is presynaptic and that its release mechanism is linked to an alpha 2 (alpha 2) adrenoceptor. It is proposed that this release of PG-like material contributes to the development of desensitisation in vascular tissue."
"1. The post-receptor mechanisms of alpha 1 and alpha 2-adrenoceptor subtypes in guinea-pig aorta and human digital arteries have been explored. 2. Nifedipine antagonized contractile responses of human digital arteries to TL99 and methoxamine to a similar degree, thus suggesting that neither the alpha 1 nor the alpha 2 receptor is preferentially linked to calcium entry through voltage-operated channels of the cell membrane. 3. In the guinea-pig aorta, which contains only alpha 1-adrenoceptors, methoxamine-stimulated inositol phosphate (IP) production at similar concentrations was required to produce contractile responses. 4. In the human digital artery, noradrenaline also produced a significant increase in IP formation, but preliminary experiments have suggested that both TL99 and methoxamine stimulate IP production. 5. Thus, the present authors have been unable as yet to confirm, in a tissue which contains both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors, that the post-receptor mechanisms of the alpha subtypes are different."
"The effect of glucose on renal responses to alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation was examined in isolated rat kidneys perfused with 5 mM lactate, 5 mM alanine, 0.5 mM pyruvate, and 0.2 mM mercaptopicolinic acid. Adding 5 mM glucose to this perfusate vasodilated the kidneys and raised the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and free water clearance without altering fractional sodium excretion. alpha 1-Adrenergic actions were evaluated with norepinephrine (NE, 60 nM), methoxamine (600 nM), and prazosin (1 microM). Glucose altered neither the vasoconstriction nor the reduction in GFR produced by NE and methoxamine but increased the antinatriuretic responses (P less than 0.001). Glucose was required for prazosin to inhibit the effect of NE on sodium and lithium excretion. The nonmetabolized glucose analogue, alpha-methyl-D-glucoside (5 mM), did not increase the antinatriuretic response to NE, therefore glucose metabolism and not Na cotransport stimulated the alpha 1-adrenergic response. Glucose did not alter alpha 1-adrenoceptor number or binding affinity for prazosin in renal cortical homogenates. We conclude that glucose metabolism in the proximal tubule is involved in the stimulation of sodium reabsorption by alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists."
"Synthetic human tumor hypercalcemic factor (1-34, hHF) was compared with parathyroid hormone (human sequence, 1-34; hPTH) for vasorelaxant activity in isolated rabbit renal artery segments. The hHF exhibited a potent (IC50 = 1.3 x 10(-9) M) and profound (98\%) relaxation which was significantly greater in magnitude than that obtained for hPTH (IC50 = 4.5 x 10(-9) M; maximal relaxation = 78\%). The relaxations to both peptides were concentration-dependent and not associated with changes in cyclic AMP levels. These results demonstrate a parathyroid hormone-like response, independent of adenylate cyclase activation, in isolated renal arteries. Renal vasodilation may be important for the effects on renal function shared by these two peptides."
"The contribution of the renin-angiotensin system to the natriuretic responses to intrarenal infusions of 1, 5, 25, and 125 pmol/kg/min synthetic rat atrial natriuretic peptide 101-126 was determined in one-kidney anesthetized dogs. In vehicle-treated dogs, atrial natriuretic peptide 101-126 increased fractional sodium excretion from 1.8 +/- 0.6\% to a peak response of 5.1 +/- 0.9\% during infusion of 25 pmol/kg/min. The peptide progressively decreased mean arterial pressure from 110 +/- 5 to 94 +/- 4 mm Hg, renal vascular resistance from 0.40 +/- 0.02 to 0.30 +/- 0.02 mm Hg/ml/min, and arterial plasma renin activity from 4.3 +/- 1.6 to 3.1 +/- 0.8 ng/ml/hr. When the renin-angiotensin system was blocked by 3 mg/kg i.v. enalaprilat, baseline pressure fell to 86 +/- 4 mm Hg, and subsequent infusions of atrial natriuretic peptide 101-126 did not affect fractional sodium excretion. The decreases in blood pressure (from 86 +/- 4 to 76 +/- 4 mm Hg) and in renal vascular resistance (from 0.27 +/- 0.03 to 0.23 +/- 0.02 mm Hg/ml/min) were also ameliorated compared with the control responses. Intravenous infusion of 2.5 ng/kg/min angiotensin II restored mean arterial pressure and potentiated the natriuretic and renal vascular responses to atrial natriuretic peptide 101-126. In two additional groups of anesthetized dogs, enalaprilat did not produce the profound hypotension and did not affect the natriuretic responses to atrial natriuretic peptide 101-126. When renal vascular resistance was elevated by intrarenal infusion of angiotensin II in enalaprilat-treated dogs, the natriuretic response was improved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Met-enkephalin concentrations in the anterior pituitary gland were shown to decline dramatically within the first 24 h after reserpine treatment, with effects apparent as early as 6 h. This was followed by subsequent repletion and late augmentation of Met-enkephalin levels 3 weeks following reserpine. Treatment with the alpha-1-adrenergic agonist methoxamine had no effect, whereas the alpha-1-antagonist prazosin lowered Met-enkephalin concentrations. Treatment with the dopamine agonists bromocriptine or apomorphine had no effect, but haloperidol treatment increased anterior pituitary Met-enkephalin which was reversed by concomitant bromocriptine administration. We postulate that the changes in anterior pituitary Met-enkephalin following reserpine were related to alterations in the monoamine neurotransmitters. Adrenergic and dopaminergic mechanisms may have opposing roles in the maintenance of Met-enkephalin concentrations in the anterior pituitary gland."
"Acting alone or in concert with pituitary gonadotropins, catecholamines have recently been shown to enhance androgen production by ovarian theca-interstitial cells. It is the objective of the in vitro studies reported herein to further characterize this catecholaminergic activity as well as to type and subtype the putative adrenergic recognition sites mediating this phenomenon. Treatment of collagenase-processed whole ovarian dispersates or highly enriched (greater than 90\%) theca-interstitial cells from immature rats with norepinephrine (10(-6) M) resulted in a 2.0-fold increment in the accumulation of androsterone (3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-androstane-17-one), the main androgenic steroid identified in culture medium by HPLC. Qualitatively similar stimulation was obtained using beta (isoproterenol)- but not alpha (methoxamine)-selective adrenergic agonists. Moreover, combined treatment with both norepinephrine (10(-6) M) and hCG (1 ng/ml) unmasked a synergistic interaction subject to stereospecific blockade by beta (propranolol)- but not alpha (phentolamine)-selective adrenergic antagonists. Further probing with subtype-selective adrenergic ligands revealed terbutaline (a beta 2-selective agonist) to enhance androgen biosynthesis, with dobutamine (a beta 1-selective agonist) having little or no effect. Moreover, a beta 2 (ICI-118406)- but not a beta 1 (ICI-89406)-selective adrenergic antagonist yielded dose-dependent inhibition of the isoproterenol effect. Unaccounted for by either enhanced cellular growth or an alteration of the overall steroidogenic pattern, catecholaminergically stimulated androgen biosynthesis proved time and dose dependent but independent of the hCG dose (0.1-10 ng/ml) employed. Binding of [125I]iodocyanopindolol to highly enriched theca-interstitial cells proved stereoselective and saturable, displaying a single class (Hill coefficient = 0.96 +/- 0.01) of high affinity (Kd = 5.6 X 10(-11) M), low capacity (1219 +/- 317 sites/cell) binding sites. The rank order of competitive potencies of selective adrenergic ligands (beta 2 greater than beta 1 greater than alpha), was consistent with a beta 2-adrenergic receptor subtype. Taken together, these findings suggest that catecholaminergic stimulation of ovarian androgen biosynthesis is mediated via beta 2-adrenergic recognition sites, the role of which may now be studied."
"The local hemodynamic effects of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) and the selective 5-HT2 antagonist ketanserin were investigated in the forearm of 20 healthy volunteers. Single doses of 5-HT (0.1-80 ng/kg/min) and ketanserin (5-125 ng/kg/min) were administered intra-arterially. The relative alpha 1-adrenergic receptor and 5-HT2 blocking potencies of ketanserin were investigated using intra-arterial infusions of cumulative doses of methoxamine (0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 microgram/kg/min), tyramine (0.25, 0.50, and 1.25 microgram/kg/min), and 5-HT (10, 30, and 80 ng/kg/min) together with a low dose (5 ng/kg/min) and a high dose (50 ng/kg/min) of ketanserin. Forearm blood flow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography. Heart rate and intra-arterial blood pressure were recorded semicontinuously. Intra-arterial infusion of 5-HT induced an initial transient vasodilatation, followed by a steady vasodilatation for the low doses of 5-HT (0.1-10 ng/kg/min; p less than 0.05). A steady vasoconstriction was only obtained at the highest dose of 5-HT. Ketanserin induced a dose-dependent increase in forearm blood flow from 15 ng/kg/min (p less than 0.05) onward. The vasodilatation induced by 5-HT (1 ng/kg/min) was significantly enhanced by ketanserin (125 ng/kg/min; p less than 0.05), whereas the vasoconstriction elicited by 5-HT (80 ng/kg/min) was reversed by ketanserin (50 ng/kg/min; p less than 0.05), thus confirming that 5-HT2 receptors were stimulated by 5-HT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Cardiac alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor sensitivities were examined after chronic pretreatment of rats with reserpine. Increases in sensitivity would indicate that the receptor is under the influence of the sympathetic innervation, removal by catecholamine depletion with reserpine of the tonic effect of neurotransmitter release would permit receptor upregulation. The positive inotropic responses of paced left atria and papillary muscles and the positive chronotropic responses of spontaneously beating right atria were recorded. A concentration-response curve to isoprenaline (beta-adrenoceptor-mediated) was followed, in the presence of beta-blockade, by one to methoxamine (alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated). Methoxamine exerted positive inotropy of left atria and papillary muscles, the maxima being 43.2 +/- 2.7 and 26.8 +/- 4.4\% of the isoprenaline maxima. A small positive chronotropy (16.5 +/- 5.6\% maximum) of right atria occurred. After pretreatment with reserpine (1.0 mg kg-1 i.p. daily) for 7 days, the three preparations displayed supersensitivity to isoprenaline, revealed as a significant displacement (P less than 0.05) of the concentration-response curves to the left of those for control rats. Reserpine pretreatment, however, had no effect on the sensitivity to methoxamine. The increase in beta-adrenoceptor sensitivity to isoprenaline after reserpine pretreatment was accompanied by a significant 41.3\% increase (P less than 0.05) in the number of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol [( 3H]-DHA) binding sites (Bmax) in ventricular membranes, although the dissociation constant (KD) was unaffected. There were more alpha-adrenoceptor [3H]-prazosin binding sites in ventricular than atrial membranes. However, there was no difference in KD or Bmax between reserpine-pretreated and control tissues.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"A series of 2-sulfonamido-1,3,4,6,7,11b alpha-hexahydro-2H-benzo[a]quinolizines were synthesized and examined for alpha 2- and alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist activity on the rat vas deferens and anococcygeus muscle, respectively. A number of compounds in this series were shown to be potent and selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists. Studies on the resolved enantiomers of compounds 6, 10, and 16 showed that alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist activity resided primarily in the 2R,11bS isomers, related to the absolute configuration of the alpha 2-antagonist yohimbine, such that the benzene ring and sulfonamide groups in this series were superimposable on the pyrrole and ester groups of yohimbine."
"The effects of the alpha-adrenergic agonist methoxamine on the human hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis was assessed by a placebo-controlled study in the morning and one in the evening. A 5-mg iv bolus dose of methoxamine in normal subjects caused a significant rise in plasma ACTH and cortisol concentrations in the morning study. However, no significant change in plasma cortisol or ACTH concentrations was noted during the evening study. These studies suggest the existence of a diurnal variation in alpha 1-adrenergic regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis."
"1. The actions of phenylephrine (0.1-100 mumol l-1) and methoxamine (0.1-100 mumol l-1) were compared with that of adrenaline (0.01-10 mumol l-1) using the single sucrose gap method and mechanical recording in the guinea-pig taenia caeci. Drugs were applied for variable periods of time. 2. The characteristics of the inhibitory effects of alpha-adrenoceptor agonists were the same when exposure time did not exceed 5 min. When the exposure was prolonged, in contrast to the sustained effects of adrenaline (0.1-3 mumol l-1), phenylephrine and methoxamine (1-10 mumol l-1) produced a transient inhibitory action. 3. During the delayed recovery phase of phenylephrine, adrenaline preserved its ability to suppress the spontaneous electrical and mechanical activities of the taenia both when phenylephrine was replaced by adrenaline or when adrenaline was applied in addition to phenylephrine. All the above effects were found in untreated preparations, as well as during blockade of muscarinic cholinoceptors by atropine (1.4 mumol l-1), beta-adrenoceptors by propranolol (3 mumol l-1) and release of endogenous catecholamines by guanethidine (2.5 mumol l-1). 4. In the presence of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate adrenaline ceased to be effective, while the inhibitory action of phenylephrine was converted to a contraction. 5. In calcium-free conditions in the presence of EGTA (0.4 mmol l-1) the initial hyperpolarization induced by adrenaline and phenylephrine was significantly reduced and with repeated applications of the agonists the inhibitory response disappeared. Similar results were obtained using tissues treated with nifedipine (1 and 10 mumol l-1). When caffeine (30mmolI 1) was present in the calciumfree solution the alpha-agonists studied were unable to produce any membrane potential changes. 6. The present results imply that the inhibitory effect of alpha-adrenoceptor agonists is mediated by the opening of potassium channels, which are activated by calcium derived from an intercellular source supplied from the extracellular space via a nifedipine-sensitive mechanism."
"To confirm the presence of alpha 2-mediated vasoconstriction in human vasculature, the effect of selective alpha 1- and alpha 2-agonists (methoxamine and B-HT 933) and antagonists (indoramin and Yohimbine) was studied in fourteen patients with mild, uncomplicated, essential hypertension. Drugs were infused, into the brachial artery at systemically ineffective rates, and concomitant changes in forearm blood flow were measured by strain gauge venous plethysmography. During control conditions, cumulative infusions either of methoxamine or B-HT 933 caused dose-related vasoconstriction, while both indoramin and yohimbine doubled forearm blood flow. Subsequently, the alpha 1-adrenoceptor mediated vasoconstriction produced by methoxamine was shown to be completely blocked by indoramin pretreatment, and to be left unchanged by yohimbine. The alpha 2-vascular stimulation by B-HT 933 was antagonized by previous yohimbine but not by indoramin pretreatment, thus fulfilling the pharmacological requirements for identification of distinct alpha-adrenoceptor mediated excitation-contraction pathways. The data provide further evidence of the existence of alpha 2-mediated vasoconstriction in human forearm vessels."
"Chloralose anesthesia is commonly used in animals for cardiovascular research despite limited data on possible receptor-drug interactions. To investigate potential interactions with alpha-adrenergic receptors, we studied the response of chronically instrumented, spontaneously breathing young lambs to alpha-receptor stimulation (by methoxamine) and blockade (by phentolamine) after infusion of 30 mg/kg of chloralose or an equal volume of vehicle. Both experiments were performed in each animal on different days and in alternate order. Chloralose altered the systemic arterial pressure and heart rate response to both alpha-agonist challenge and to alpha-blockade when compared with control. Despite potentiating the systemic arterial pressor response to methoxamine, chloralose attenuated the reflex decrease in heart rate after alpha-agonist-induced hypertension. This observation suggests that the baroreceptor reflex was blunted. Chloralose, commonly considered an ideal anesthetic for cardiovascular studies, may have important effects on the cardiovascular response to alpha-adrenergic test agents. The potential for interactive effects should be considered in experimental designs that couple the use of chloralose and alpha-adrenergic agents."
"The role of central alpha-1 adrenergic receptors in cataplexy was investigated in genetically narcoleptic Doberman pinschers. Treatment of narcoleptic dogs with 25-600 micrograms/kg prazosin, a selective alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker, exacerbated cataplexy, whereas treatment with the alpha-1 agonist, methoxamine, ameliorated it. Subsequent studies showed that the beneficial effects of classical treatments of human narcolepsy (amphetamines and tricyclic antidepressants) are antagonized by prazosin, suggesting that these drugs are active through an indirect alpha-1 stimulation (via an increase of norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft). Other studies confirmed that the observed effects were not due to peripheral alpha-1 cardiovascular involvement. Atropine, a central anticholinergic agent, but not methylatropine, a peripheral one, completely suppressed the prazosin effect, which suggests that adrenergic and cholinergic systems act sequentially and not independently to generate cataplexy. Little is known about the physiological role of central alpha-1 adrenoceptors. This series of experiments implicates these receptors in narcolepsy-cataplexy."
"The role of intracellular signals in the regulation of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) release was studied using the isolated left and right atria from a rat. The atria were perfused with Tyrode's solution, equilibrated with 95\% O2-5\% CO2 at 37 degrees C with a constant flow of 0.5 ml/min. Addition of epinephrine (10(-6) M), an alpha- and beta-agonist, to the perfusate induced the biphasic release of ANP from the right atrium without effect on the left. The initial peak (19.2 +/- 2.6 pg.min-1.ml-1) occurs 2-4 min after the administration of epinephrine, which lasted 4-6 min and returned to base line (10.4 +/- 1.1 pg.min-1.mg-1). The second peak (16.5 +/- 2.0 pg.min-1.ml-1) appeared 30-35 min after epinephrine administration and was sustained for 100 min, at which time the experiment was terminated. The first peak was stimulated by isoproterenol (10(-6) M), a beta-agonist, and blunted by propranolol (10(-6) M), a beta-antagonist. The second peak appeared following methoxamine (10(-6) M), an alpha-agonist, and could be suppressed by phentolamine (10(-6) M), an alpha-antagonist. These studies indirectly suggest that the adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate system and the inositol triphosphate system are involved in ANP secretion, with the former responsible for the initial rapid release and the latter maintaining the secretion."
"The significance of alpha-adrenergic-mediated effects of norepinephrine on cardiac pacemakers is still controversial. Sinus node preparations (SN) from guinea pig hearts were superfused with Tyrode's solution (36 degrees C) to investigate such actions. Intracellular microelectrodes were used to monitor sinus node rate and membrane potentials of SN subsidiary pacemaker fibers (SP). Membrane potentials were recorded before, during, and after 10 minutes of exposure to norepinephrine in low (10(-13)-10(-10) M) or high (10(-6) M) concentrations. Low norepinephrine did not modify the sinus node rate or the membrane potentials. High norepinephrine increased the sinus node rate as expected. In the presence of propranolol, high norepinephrine did not modify the sinus node rate, but the action potential duration of SP was increased, whereas the membrane resting potential and the amplitude of the action potential were unchanged. The alpha-adrenergic agonist methoxamine did not depress the automaticity of the sinus node preparations, but the antagonist phentolamine blocked the effect of high norepinephrine on the action potential duration. In summary, norepinephrine did not have an alpha-mediated action on the automaticity of the guinea pig sinus node preparations, but it did prolong the action potential duration through alpha-receptor stimulation. The conflicting results reported in the literature regarding the effects of alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation in the heart appear to be due to species differences in the number and/or affinity of receptors."
"The receptors mediating adrenergic stimulation of acid secretion by Amphiuma jejunum were characterized in this study using alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists. Isolated segments of jejunum were mounted in Ussing chambers and bathed in Cl- -free (SO4(2-] medium. Shortcircuit current (Isc) and acid secretion (JH) were recorded, the latter by measuring the rate of alkalinization of the serosal medium. The beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol (10(-4) M), had no effect on the Isc and JH stimulated by norepinephrine (NE). The alpha 2-adrenergic agonists, clonidine and UK-14,304, mimicked the effect of NE, with effective concentrations providing 50\% maximal delta Isc of 2.0 X 10(-7) and 9.0 X 10(-8) M, respectively. NE added subsequently produced no greater stimulation. In contrast, the alpha 1-adrenergic agonists, phenylephrine and methoxamine, produced little stimulation of JH and Isc; NE added subsequently stimulated the Isc. The alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin had no effect on the NE-induced Isc or JH, whereas the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine inhibited the NE-stimulated Isc with a half-maximal effective concentration of 3.5 X 10(-7) M. Yohimbine (10(-4) M) reduced the NE-stimulated Isc by 88\%, whereas the spontaneous Isc was reduced by only 12\%. These results demonstrate that alpha 2-adrenergic receptors on the basolateral membrane of Amphiuma enterocytes mediate NE-enhanced, but not spontaneous, intestinal acid secretion."
"DSP-4, a neurotoxin which produces a marked and long-lasting depletion of norepinephrine (NE) in the central nervous system, was given in a dose of 50 mg/kg by i.p. route to rats prepared for chronic sleep recordings. Light sleep was significantly increased and REM sleep decreased during the first 2 days following DSP-4. Thereafter, REM sleep showed a consistent increase which attained significance on days 5 and 6 postinjection, thus indicating a permissive role for NE on this behavioral state. We examined also whether pretreatment with DSP-4 would modify the effects of clonidine, yohimbine, methoxamine, or clenbuterol on sleep and wakefulness. The sensitivity to alpha 2-agents, methoxamine, and clenbuterol was respectively slightly increased or unchanged, decreased, and clearly increased after DSP-4."
"The inotropic effect of methoxamine, as well as the alpha-adrenoceptor population, were measured in cardiac tissue from normal and short-term (3 days) diabetic rats. Methoxamine increased the tension of both normal and diabetic ventricles, but in diabetic ones, the dose-response curve to methoxamine was shifted to the left and the efficacy of the alpha-agonist was enhanced. This phenomenon was accompanied by an increase in receptor affinity, while the number of alpha-adrenoceptor sites decreased. Inhibitors of alpha 1-adrenoceptors blocked, in a competitive manner, the positive inotropic effect of methoxamine in both types of ventricles. Inhibition of phospholipase C blocked the ventricular response to the methoxamine in nondiabetic as well as in diabetic hearts. Synthetic diacylglyceride (DAG) potentiated the inotropic action of the alpha-agonist in normal ventricles and increased the affinity with a decreased number of alpha-adrenoceptor sites in normal ventricles, producing values of Kd and Bmax similar to those of the acute diabetic heart. Inhibitors of protein kinase C partially reduced the supersensitivity to alpha-agonists in diabetic ventricles and prevented the stimulatory action of DAG upon the positive inotropic effect of methoxamine in normal ventricles. These results suggest that alpha-adrenergic inotropic stimulation is secondary to receptor-mediated hydrolysis of phosphoinositides, generating some oxidative metabolites (DAG) which, in turn, may be responsible for the inotropic effect. In the acute diabetic state, the supersensitivity to alpha-agonist could be due to high activity of phospholipase C (with an increase in DAG production) which induces alteration in the membrane alpha-adrenergic receptors."
"The inhibitory effect of nitroglycerin (NG) on contractile responses to methoxamine (MO) and clonidine (CL) was investigated in isolated rabbit renal and femoral arteries. NG (10(-7)-10(-5) mol/l) inhibited the responses to MO and CL in a noncompetitive manner and its inhibitory effect on CL-responses was much greater than that on the MO-responses. In the presence of phenoxybenzamine, however, NG (10(-5) mol/l) markedly inhibited the residual response to MO. Contractile responses to KCl or added Ca2+ in a Ca2+-free medium containing KCl were slightly inhibited by NG. In the presence of nifedipine, NG (10(-5) mol/l) markedly inhibited residual responses to CL but it only slightly inhibited the response to MO. In a Ca2+-free medium with EGTA, MO (10(-5) mol/l) or CL (10(-5) mol/l) induced a phasic contraction. NG had a greater inhibitory effect on the response to CL than MO. In a Ca2+-free medium with EGTA, nifedipine and MO (10(-5) mol/l) or CL (10(-5) mol/l), Ca2+ induced a tonic contraction. NG inhibited the Ca2+-response in the presence of CL, but it had little or no effect on the Ca2+-response in the presence of MO. These results suggest that in rabbit renal and femoral arteries, the potent inhibitory effect of NG on the responses to CL as compared to MO may be due to differences in the amount of receptor reserves that exist for both the agonists. In addition, the inhibition of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels may not play a major role in the vasoinhibitory action of NG. Further, NG inhibits contractile responses due to mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ much more than the responses due to receptor-activated, nifedipine-insensitive Ca2+-movement."
"To define transmembrane and intracellular mechanisms of production and release of atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) in the absence of mechanical atrial stretch, we studied the direct effects of physiological stimuli on isolated adult rat atrial myocytes maintained under tissue culture. Although stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors on the surface of atrial myocytes by isoproterenol did not affect ANP release, adrenergic alpha-1 receptor stimulation by methoxamine enhanced ANP release with reciprocal intracellular ANP reduction. When muscarinic receptors were stimulated by acetylcholine, ANP release was accelerated and intracellular ANP reduced. The activation of the phosphatidylinositol system, which is a common pathway for muscarinic and alpha-1 adrenergic receptor stimulation, was thus considered to regulate ANP release, but not ANP production."
"Alterations in vascular alpha-adrenoceptor responsiveness following sinoaortic denervation was studied in conscious rats. The arterial hypertension observed in baroreceptor denervated rats decreased progressively during the 30 days of observation. A pressor hyperresponsiveness to methoxamine (10-80 micrograms/kg, iv), was observed 3 to 7 days after baroreceptor denervation followed by a gradual normalization of the vascular reactivity. The results indicate a possible participation of an enhanced alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstrictor component in the early phase of neurogenic hypertension."
"Modulation of lordosis behavior by stimulation of noradrenergic receptor subtypes was examined in ovariectomized, estradiol benzoate (10 micrograms)-primed guinea pigs. In the first experiment, subcutaneous administration of the alpha-2-noradrenergic agonist, UK-14,304 (0.01, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg, Pfizer Central Research), produced a significant increase in lordosis behavior when these animals were compared with estrogen-primed control animals injected with saline. In a second experiment, estrogen-primed animals were injected with the alpha-1-noradrenergic agonist methoxamine (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.), UK-14,304 (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.), or both drugs given together. Methoxamine or UK-14,304 administered alone facilitated lordosis in fewer than 50\% of animals (17 and 39\%, respectively). However, when both drugs were given together, 76\% of the animals became sexually receptive. A third experiment showed that lordosis behavior facilitated by UK-14,304 could be attenuated by the administration of the alpha-2-noradrenergic antagonist idazoxan (2.5 mg/kg, s.c.). Only 29\% of sexually receptive animals (i.e. those animals primed with estradiol benzoate plus UK-14,304) continued to show lordosis after they received idazoxan. The results obtained from these and previously reported experiments suggest that both alpha-1- and alpha-2-noradrenergic receptors are involved in the regulation of lordosis behavior in the guinea pig."
"Experiments were undertaken to determine if prejunctional alpha 1-adrenoceptors are involved in autoinhibitory regulation of transmitter noradrenaline release in rat atria. The noradrenergic transmitter stores in rat isolated atria were radiolabelled with [3H]noradrenaline and transmitter release was deduced from the efflux of the radiolabel evoked by field stimulation of the atrial intramural sympathetic nerves. Phentolamine (3 mumol/l) and prazosin (0.1 and 3 mumol/l) enhanced the release of radiolabel evoked by stimulation with trains of 4, 8 and 16 pulses, whereas idazoxan (10 mumol/l) enhanced release evoked by stimulation with 8 and 16 pulses. Idazoxan and prazosin were about equi-effective in enhancing the evoked release but phentolamine produced much greater enhancement than either idazoxan or prazosin. Combination of idazoxan (10 mumol/l) and prazosin enhanced the stimulation-evoked release with 4, 8 and 16 pulses to the same extent as phentolamine (3 mumol/l). The selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine (10 mumol/l) inhibited stimulation-evoked release and this effect was blocked by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (0.1 mumol/l). The findings indicate that alpha 1-adrenoceptors may contribute to autoinhibitory feedback regulation of transmitter release in rat atria."
"Strips of rabbit main pulmonary artery (RMPA) were used to study the effects of several agonists on tension development and membrane potential of the vascular smooth muscle cells. The following alpha-adrenoceptor agonists were employed: methoxamine and St 587 (alpha 1-selective), B-HT920 (alpha 2-selective) and clonidine, which stimulates preferentially alpha 2-adrenoceptors. By the use of the selective antagonists prazosin and yohimbine it was not possible to differentiate convincingly between alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors in the RMPA. Methoxamine and B-HT920 produced depolarization of similar magnitude of the membrane of the vascular smooth muscle cells. In spite of these results, which point to a uniform alpha-adrenoceptor in the RMPA, contractions to alpha 1- and alpha 2-agonists differed in some important aspects. Contractions in response to alpha 2-agonists were highly susceptible to the inhibitory effects of calcium withdrawal and calcium antagonists whereas contractions to alpha 1-agonists were much less so. Reduction of the membrane potential of the vascular cells by K+ at 12 mmol/l had no effect on the concentration-contraction curve of methoxamine but shifted that of B-HT920 to the left. Conversely hyperpolarization of the membrane of the vascular smooth muscle cells by strychnine totally suppressed contraction to B-HT920 and caused only a rightward shift of the concentration-contraction curve of methoxamine and St 587. Interaction of alpha 1- and alpha 2-agonists with an apparently uniform alpha-adrenoceptor induces in the RMPA contraction which seems to be triggered by different membrane processes."
"The effects of varying [Ca2+]o on the contraction of smooth muscle by different alpha-adrenoceptor agonists were examined on rat isolated anococcygeus muscle. Agonists were tested in the presence of various [Ca2+]o or 'Ca2+-re-addition curves' were constructed. In some experiments the [Ca2+]free was buffered with EGTA and nitrilotriacetic acid. The components of the response which were revealed were further analysed by using drugs which modify Ca2+ mobilization. Three separate elements in the contractile response were identified: (i) an initial transient contraction, due to intracellular Ca2+ release could be isolated with [Ca2+]o between 1 nmol/l and 3 mumol/l (this could be obtained only with noradrenaline, phenylephrine and amidephrine); (ii) a nifedipine-sensitive response requiring [Ca2+]o of 3 mumol/l or more; (iii) a nifedipine-resistant response requiring [Ca2+]o of 100 mumol/l or more. Presumably (ii) and (iii) involve the entry of Ca2+o: they could be obtained with all agonists tested, including these above, methoxamine, indanidine and xylazine. The results are discussed in relation to the possibility of distinct types of response and their relationship to subgroups of receptors or agonists. It is concluded that there is a continuous spectrum of activity across the agonist range and that this is likely to correlate with 'efficacy' at a single alpha 1 receptor type."
"It is well known that the vascular endothelial cell layer plays an essential role in the vasodilatory response of several agents. In this study we have investigated the possibility that the endothelium may also modulate alpha adrenergic agonist-induced vasoconstriction. The responses of rat aortae to selective alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic agonists were studied. Removal of the endothelium did not significantly alter the maximum contractile response to norepinephrine. However, the maximum responses to selective alpha-1 agonists (phenylephrine and methoxamine) were increased 2-fold. The vasoconstrictor effects of both clonidine and B-HT920 (selective alpha-2 agonists) were enhanced 5- to 7-fold after removal of the endothelial cell layer. The sensitivity of the tissue, as reflected by the EC50 value, to each alpha adrenergic agonist was enhanced in the absence of endothelium. An explanation for the present results is that alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic agonists activate adrenoceptors in the endothelial cells and thereby may promote the release of a relaxing factor to inhibit vascular smooth muscle contraction. Removal of the endothelium would abolish release of this putative inhibitory substance and adrenergic agonist would activate only adrenoceptors in the muscle to cause vasoconstriction. On the other hand, endothelial cells may function as an uptake site for the various adrenergic agonists. Ablation of this uptake process could conceivably result in a greater effective concentration of the agonist in the receptor area and thus promote a stronger vasoconstrictor effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"To examine the pharmacologic nature of parasympathetic decentralization on feline vesical smooth muscle, male cats were subjected to bilateral ventral rhizotomy from levels lumbar 7 to coccygeal 1 and studied at 1 and 3 months. By employing manual bladder decompression twice daily, compensatory bladder hypertrophy was absent or minimal in all specimens. In vitro muscle bath studies of bladder body demonstrated no significant end organ pharmacologic supersensitivity to cholinergic or alpha and beta adrenergic stimulation. Membrane receptor assays displayed a rise in muscarinic cholinergic and beta adrenergic receptors at 1 month which decreased at 3 months. The cholinergic receptor data parallels ultrastructural studies which demonstrate early cholinergic nerve terminal degeneration after motor decentralization followed by subsequent regrowth of cholinergic axons. Alpha 1 and alpha 2 adrenergic receptor densities remained constant in control, 1 month, and 3 month preparations. This lack of classic end organ denervation supersensitivity in the decentralized urinary bladder suggests that other mechanisms may be responsible for eliciting a positive response with the clinical denervation supersensitivity test."
"The effects of perivascular nerve stimulation and application of exogenous alpha-adrenoceptor agonists on the rat saphenous vein were studied by simultaneous recordings of electrical and mechanical activities. The resting membrane potential of the saphenous vein averaged -65 mV. Perivascular nerve stimulation elicited excitatory junction potentials (e.j.ps) and slow depolarizations. Contraction was observed when either the e.j.p. or the slow depolarization reached a critical threshold of about -55 mV. Exogenously applied noradrenaline, B-HT 920 and clonidine induced depolarization and contraction similar to the slow depolarization. The responses to these agonists and the slow depolarizations were antagonized by yohimbine, but not by prazosin. The selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists phenylephrine and methoxamine had very little effect on the electrical and mechanical activities of the saphenous vein. It was concluded that in the rat saphenous vein, only alpha 2-adrenoceptors are present and that these receptors mediate the slow depolarization and contraction induced by nerve stimulation."
"A study was undertaken in the anaesthetized rabbit to classify the alpha-adrenoceptor subtypes responsible for increasing renal tubular sodium reabsorption and renin secretion. Intrarenal administration of noradrenaline, at doses which did not change renal blood flow or glomerular filtration rate, significantly decreased urine flow, absolute and fractional sodium excretion by between 26\% and 29\%. These renal responses to noradrenaline were abolished by the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, but not by the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, idazoxan. Noradrenaline, given intrarenally, increased renin secretion between two and three fold and this response was not modified by either prazosin or idazoxan. Intrarenal administration of the selective alpha-adrenoceptor agonists, phenylephrine and methoxamine, at dose rates which did not change renal haemodynamics, significantly reduced urine flow, absolute and fractional sodium excretion by 15\% to 33\%, but at doses which reduced blood flow and filtration rate, by between 11\% and 26\%, urine flow, absolute and fractional sodium excretion decreased between 42\% and 49\%. Infusion of guanabenz (selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist), at doses with no renal haemodynamic action, increased urine flow, absolute and fractional sodium excretion by 11\% to 15\%, while at doses which decreased blood flow by 7\%, these other variables did not change. Administration of UK 14304 (selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist) reduced blood flow and filtration rate by 3\% and 9\% respectively but had no other measurable action. At higher doses, which decreased blood flow by 14\% and filtration rate by 24\%, urine flow, absolute and fractional sodium excretion fell by between 27\% and 50\%. Renin secretion was significantly increased by the high doses of phenylephrine and UK 14304 but not by the low doses of these drugs. These studies show that adrenergic stimulation of renal tubular sodium reabsorption involves the activation of alpha 1- but not alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Further, adrenergic activation of the juxtaglomerular cells to release renin does not appear to involve either alpha 1- or alpha 2-adrenoceptors."
"In the present study the effect of methoxamine and its modification by several adrenergic antagonists is described in the isolated oestrogenized rat uterus. Methoxamine produced a dose-related increase in uterine activity, prazosin produced a rightward displacement of the dose-response curve of methoxamine reaching the same maximal effect. Yohimbine abolished the contractile response to methoxamine. propranolol or reserpine failed to modify the effect of methoxamine. Pretreatment with reserpine abolished the inhibitory effect of yohimbine. These results suggest the presence of excitatory alpha-adrenoceptors in the rat uterus."
"This paper documents some of the lesser-known effects of antihistamines on nasal blood vessel smooth muscle. An in vitro muscle tension detecting technique was utilized. Three different H1 receptor antagonists (pyrilamine maleate, chlorpheniramine maleate, promethazine hydrochloride), and the H2 antagonist metiamide were used. Besides their basic antihistaminic effect, H1 antagonists (classical antihistamines) induced a contraction, enhanced norepinephrine- and epinephrine-induced contractions, and relaxed the sustained contraction induced by methoxamine hydrochloride or high concentrations of potassium. Although these effects were quite similar to those induced by histamine, the mechanism of each effect was apparently different. Metiamide did not produce these effects except for the relaxation of the sustained contraction. The actions of histamine antagonists seem to be much more complicated than expected."
"Partial bladder outlet obstruction is a commonly encountered pathophysiologic state. Recently we have reported on the rapid nature of the contractile and functional changes that occur in the rabbit urinary bladder within one week of chronic partial obstruction. The purpose of this present study is to investigate the ability of the bladder to recover from one week of partial obstruction. Twenty-six mature male white New Zealand rabbits were separated into 3 groups. Each rabbit was anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine and a partial obstruction of the bladder established by gently securing a 2.0 silk suture around the temporarily catheterized bladder neck. The rabbits in group 1 were sacrificed following one week of partial obstruction. For groups 2 and 3, the obstructing suture was surgically removed after one week of obstruction adn the rabbit was allowed to recover for either two or four weeks. At the end of one week of obstruction the bladder displayed a 9-fold increase in tissue mass, 50 per cent reduction in contractile response to bethanechol and a 76 per cent reduction in the ability of the bladder to expel saline. After the two week recovery period, the bladder mass was reduced to approximately twice the control mass, the contractile and pressure responses to bethanechol were returned to control levels, and the ability of the bladder to expel saline recovered to approximately 75 per cent of control levels. No further improvements were observed following the four week recovery period. It appears that although the contractile response recovers completely following the one week obstruction period, the ability of the bladder to empty remains partially impaired."
"To determine the interaction between alpha 1-adrenergic and vasopressinergic mechanisms in the central regulation of cardiovascular functions, the effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of the alpha 1-agonists, methoxamine and phenylephrine, were examined in conscious Long-Evans (LE) rats and Brattleboro rats with hereditary hypothalamic diabetes insipidus (DI). In LE rats, i.c.v. methoxamine and phenylephrine (3-30 micrograms/kg) increased blood pressure and decreased heart rate in a dose-related manner, while they had no detectable cardiovascular effects in DI rats. Neither i.c.v. (0.5 ng/kg per min, 1 h) nor intravenous (i.v., 2 ng/kg per min, 2 h) infusion of vasopressin (AVP) restored the cardiovascular response to i.c.v. phenylephrine in DI rats. In LE rats, however, i.v. pretreatment with the specific antagonist to the pressor effect of AVP, d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP (10 micrograms/kg), attenuated the hypertensive and bradycardic effects of i.c.v. phenylephrine, while i.c.v. pretreatment with AVP antagonist (300 ng/kg) did not alter the cardiovascular response to i.c.v. alpha 1-agonist. The cardiovascular response to i.c.v. phenylephrine was blocked by i.c.v. pretreatment with the alpha 1-antagonist, prazosin (2 micrograms/kg). Intracerebroventricular phenylephrine increased plasma AVP levels 14-fold without affecting plasma angiotensin II levels. The present study clearly demonstrated that endogenous AVP plays a significant role in the cardiovascular response to i.c.v. alpha 1-agonist."
"Whether pressor responses mediated by alpha-2 adrenoceptors are more susceptible to calcium antagonists than those mediated by alpha-1 adrenoceptors was investigated in anesthetized, spinal dogs. All drugs were administered i.v. Methoxamine (3-100 mu/kg) or xylazine (3-300 micrograms/kg) produced a sustained increase in mean arterial pressure but almost no effect on heart rate. Both the initial and the sustained phase of the pressor response to methoxamine were selectively antagonized by prazosin, whereas those to xylazine were selectively antagonized by yohimbine. These results indicate that the peripheral arterial bed of the dog comprises alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors and that both the initial and sustained phases of the pressor response to methoxamine are predominantly mediated by alpha-1 adrenoceptors, whereas those to xylazine are mediated by alpha-2 adrenoceptors. The calcium antagonists, i.e., nifedipine (0.3-3 micrograms/kg), diltiazem (10-100 micrograms/kg) and KB-944 (10-100 micrograms/kg), administered during the sustained phase of the pressor responses to equieffective doses of methoxamine (100 micrograms/kg) and xylazine (1000 micrograms/kg), lowered mean arterial pressure. The three calcium antagonists in these doses also lowered the baseline mean arterial pressure but to a lesser extent than the elevated one. These results altogether indicate that the calcium antagonists were more effective in lowering mean arterial pressure elevated by either an alpha-1 or alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist than the base-line mean arterial pressure and that the sustained phase of the pressor response mediated by alpha-1 adrenoceptors would involve Ca++ influx as much as or more than those mediated by alpha-2 adrenoceptors."
"The subtypes of postjunctional alpha-adrenoceptors in the feline pulmonary vascular bed were studied using selective alpha-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists. Under conditions of controlled pulmonary blood flow and constant left atrial pressure, intralobar injections of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists, phenylephrine and methoxamine, and the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists, UK 14,304 and BHT 933, increased lobar arterial pressure in a dose-related manner. Prazosin, an alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, reduced responses to phenylephrine and methoxamine to a greater extent than responses to UK 14,304 and BHT 933. Yohimbine, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor blocker, decreased responses to UK 14,304 and BHT 933 without altering responses to phenylephrine or methoxamine. The same pattern of blockade was observed in animals pretreated with 6-hydroxydopamine, an agent that destroys the integrity of adrenergic nerve terminals. However, in propranolol-treated animals, prazosin antagonized responses to phenylephrine and methoxamine without altering responses to UK 14,304 or BHT 933, and the selectivity of the blocking effects of yohimbine were preserved. Responses to intralobar injections of norepinephrine were markedly decreased by prazosin, whereas yohimbine had only a small effect. These data suggest the presence of both postjunctional alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors mediating vasoconstriction in the pulmonary vascular bed. These results also indicate that the vasoconstrictor responses to injected norepinephrine in the cat pulmonary vascular bed are due mainly to activation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors."
"Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes (8 weeks) produced a marked depressor effect in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), confirming earlier studies, but had no effect on arterial pressure of normotensive controls (WKY). We investigated the phenomenon further by examining the effects of diabetes on the activities of aortic prolyl hydroxylase (PH) and lysyl oxidase (LO), marker enzymes for collagen biosynthesis, and on the reactivity of isolated mesenteric arteries to vasoactive agents. PH and LO activities of nondiabetic SHR were greater than those of the WKY controls. Diabetes markedly reduced PH and LO activities of SHR aortae, but had no significant effect on PH and LO activities of the WKY strain. The effects of diabetes on vascular collagen biosynthetic enzymes of SHR were not associated with reductions in mesenteric arterial responsiveness or sensitivity to norepinephrine, methoxamine, serotonin or KC1. These results suggest that the depressor effect of diabetes in SHR is associated with a reduction in vascular collagen biosynthesis but not a reduction in vascular reactivity."
"The influence of nonselective and selective alpha-adrenergic agonists on intraocular pressure (IOP) was studied in isolated arterially perfused rabbit eyes. Drugs were given intra-arterially or topically. With either route of administration, no initial hypertensive phase was observed after l-epinephrine, l-norepinephrine, l-phenylephrine (alpha 1), or methoxamine (alpha 1), but there was an immediate ocular hypotensive effect. The alpha 2-agonist B-HT 920 caused a nonsignificant 1 mm Hg fall in IOP."
"Coronary hypoperfusion was elicited in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized open-chest dogs by reducing left coronary perfusion pressure to 50 mmHg. Left coronary blood flow, as well as left ventricular oxygen extraction, oxygen consumption, and contractile force were measured. The reduction in perfusion pressure caused significant reductions in coronary flow, oxygen consumption, and peak reactive hyperemic flow. During hypoperfusion in 11 dogs, intracoronary infusion of the specific alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin (0.1 mg/min) increased coronary flow and oxygen consumption by 22 and 16\%, respectively. Peak increases were observed after 6-8 min of prazosin infusion (0.6-0.8 mg prazosin), and both increases were statistically significant (P less than 0.05). In seven additional dogs, beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol (1.0 mg ic) did not significantly affect the actions of prazosin. In five additional dogs, the specific alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine (1.3 mg ic) in the presence of propranolol (1.0 mg ic) did not affect coronary flow or oxygen consumption during coronary hypoperfusion. Those results suggest that an alpha 1- but not an alpha 2-adrenergic constrictor tone was operative in the left coronary circulation under the conditions of these experiments."
"The adverse effects of tris (hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane (Tris) are for the first time reported on melanophore responses to agonists and potassium chloride. Melanophore responses in Tris- or bicarbonate-buffered solutions were compared. In the presence of Tris, the cumulative dose-response curve to norepinephrine was significantly shifted to the left, whereas methoxamine dose-response curves were similar in both buffers. The percentage aggregation in response to synthetic MCH (melanin concentrating hormone) was not affected by Tris in the bathing medium. The cumulative dose-response curve to potassium chloride was leftward shifted (one log case) in Tris-buffered solution. These results suggest that in fish melanophore preparations Tris might exert its actions on the presynaptic membrane and/or on the synaptic cleft enzyme COMT, drawing on a greater availability of neurotransmitters at the melanophore membrane receptors."
"The effect of ifenprodil on the contractile responses of the rat anococcygeus muscle to noradrenaline, methoxamine, carbachol, potassium chloride and calcium chloride has been examined. Ifenprodil (10(-8)-10(-7) M) non-competitively antagonized noradrenaline and methoxamine-induced contractions while carbachol-induced responses were unaffected. Similarly, contractile responses to KCl (in tissues from reserpinized animals, or tissues bathed in Tyrode containing 10(-6) M phentolamine) and CaCl2 in tissues bathed with Ca2+-free depolarizing solution were blocked non-competitively by ifenprodil (10(-7)-10(-6) M). These findings suggest that ifenprodil possesses alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist activity, with intrinsic Ca2+ blocking properties."
"To determine the interaction between central adrenergic and vasopressinergic mechanisms in the regulation of cardiovascular function, the effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of the alpha 1-agonists, methoxamine and phenylephrine, in conscious Long-Evans (LE) rats were compared with those in Brattleboro rats with hereditary hypothalamic diabetes insipidus (DI). In LE rats, both i.c.v. methoxamine and phenylephrine increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) and decreased heart rate (HR) in a dose-related manner, while they had no effect on MAP and HR in DI rats within the dose range of 3-30 micrograms/kg. Both i.c.v. methoxamine (10 micrograms/kg) and phenylephrine (30 micrograms/kg) also increased plasma levels of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in LE rats from 2.6 +/- 0.4 (n = 9) to 22.4 +/- 3.5 (n = 6, P less than 0.01) and 37.0 +/- 4.0 pg/ml (n = 6, P less than 0.01), respectively, without affecting plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma angiotensin II (ANG II) levels. Central alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation increases vasopressin release from the posterior pituitary, which in part is responsible for the hypertensive and bradycardic responses. However, central vasopressinergic pathways have also been shown to be involved in these cardiovascular effects. Neither i.c.v. nor intravenous (i.v.) infusion of AVP restored the cardiovascular response to i.c.v. alpha 1-agonists in DI rats. In LE rats, however, i.v. pretreatment with the specific vascular antagonist to the pressor effect of AVP, d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP (VP-ANT; 10 micrograms/kg), significantly attenuated, but did not completely block the hypertensive and bradycardic effects of i.c.v. methoxamine and phenylephrine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"The sensitivity of the mouse anococcygeus to contraction by oxytocin was shown to be Mg2+-dependent. Decreasing [Mg2+]0 from the optimal concentration of 1 to 0 mM caused a 20-fold parallel rightward displacement of the oxytocin dose-response curve. Contractions to oxytocin-related peptides (Arg-vasotocin, Arg-vasopressin and Lys-vasopressin) were also Mg2+-dependent, but those to other drugs (carbachol, methoxamine and thyrotrophin releasing hormone) were not. The onset of the potentiating effect of Mg2+ was rapid, full potentiation occurring within 70 s. 1-Deaminopenicillamine 8-ornithine-vasotocin produced competitive antagonism of responses to oxytocin, but was more potent in the absence (pA2 = 8.01) than in the presence of Mg2+ (1 mM; pA2 = 7.52). Thus, physiological concentrations of [Mg2+]0 enhanced oxytocin agonist potency but decreased oxytocin antagonist potency; possible mechanisms are discussed."
"The relative fractional distribution of 51Cr-labelled microspheres was evaluated in pithed rats during equieffective vascoconstrictor responses evoked by infusions of the alpha-adrenoreceptor agonists methoxamine (alpha 1-selective), UK-14,304 (alpha 2-selective) or vasopressin. The proportion of injected radioactive microspheres trapped in each tissue during a sustained pressor response relative to saline treated controls is considered a reflection of the degree of local vascoconstriction in the tissue analysed. All three agonists (methoxamine, UK-14,304 and vasopressin) decreased the number of microspheres trapped in the mesentery and tail. Only methoxamine reduced the blood flow to the kidney and spleen. UK-14,304 did not modify the number of microspheres in the sample of skeletal muscle, however, both vasopressin and methoxamine reduced the blood flow to this tissue. Vasopressin increased the counts in the lungs and particularly in the liver but decreased the number of spheres trapped in the stomach and skin. In contrast to the alpha-adrenoreceptor agonists, vasopressin did not increase the number of microspheres trapped in the heart. Since a reduction in the number of microspheres trapped in the tissue reflects a decrease in blood flow, to that organ it is reasonable to conclude that alpha 1-adrenoreceptor stimulation increases kidney, spleen, mesentery, caudal and skeletal muscle vascular resistance, whereas alpha 2-adrenoreceptors appear to preferentially vasoconstrict the mesenteric and the caudal vascular beds."
"Administration of LY171555, a specific dopamine D2 receptor agonist, (10-1000 micrograms/kg i.v.) produced dose-related increases in mean arterial pressure in conscious Sprague-Dawley rats. Pretreatment with metoclopramide (5 mg/kg i.v.) abolished the pressor action of LY171555, whereas pretreatment with domperidone (2.5 mg/kg i.v.) and propranolol (10 mg/kg i.p.) did not affect the pressor action of LY171555. The vasopressor antagonist of arginine vasopressin (AVP), d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP (10 micrograms/kg i.v.) and phenoxybenzamine (1 mg/kg i.v.) partly blocked and hexamethonium (25 mg/kg i.v.) enhanced the pressor action of LY171555. After combined treatment with both d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP and phenoxybenzamine, LY171555 induced a depressor response which was completely blocked by pretreatment with domperidone. LY171555 administration induced a rapid, short-acting depressor response followed by a pressor response in conscious adrenomedullectomized Sprague-Dawley rats which was smaller in magnitude than that seen in intact Sprague-Dawley rats. LY171555 administration increased plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine and AVP in conscious Sprague-Dawley rats. These results suggest that the pressor action of LY171555 in conscious rats is dependent on activation of sympathetic outflow and AVP release through the central D2 dopaminergic system and that the central pressor effects of LY171555 could mask a depressor effect of LY171555 at the peripheral D2 dopamine receptor."
"The reactivity to methoxamine (Met) of atria isolated from the hearts of normal and from acutely streptozotocin-diabetic rats has been studied. Met (1 X 10(-6) M) increased the tension of both normal and diabetic atria, but in diabetic atria, the dose-response curve to Met was shifted to the left and the efficacy of Met was enhanced. Inhibitors of alpha-adrenoceptors blocked, in a competitive manner, the positive inotropic effect induced by Met in both types of atrial preparations. Inhibitors of the cyclo-oxygenase pathway for arachidonic acid metabolism blocked the atrial response to Met in non-diabetic as well as in diabetic atria. The inhibition of prostacyclin synthetase prevented the effect of Met in normal atria, while blockers of thromboxane generation inhibited it in diabetic ones. Agents that inhibit the activity of lipoxygenase(s) significantly reduced the positive inotropic action induced by Met in diabetic atria but failed to modify it in non-diabetic preparations. These results show that diabetic atria are more sensitive to Met than normal atria. In diabetes the response to alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation could be mediated by oxidative product generated via thromboxane synthetase and lipoxygenase(s) activities; whereas in normal preparations the action of Met may involve the release of prostacyclin."
"The effects of norepinephrine, epinephrine and clonidine on neurogenic cholinergic contraction were examined in the presence of a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, carteolol (5 X 10(-6) M), in the isolated intestinal bulb of the carp. Norepinephrine, epinephrine (10(-9)-10(-6) M) and clonidine (10(-8)-10(-5) M) inhibited the contraction induced by low frequency (2 or 5 Hz) transmural stimulation (TMS) without inhibiting the contraction induced by acetylcholine (ACh, 6 X 10(-8)-4 X 10(-7) M). Methoxamine (10(-4) M) and phenylephrine (10(-4) M) showed no such inhibitory effect on the TMS-induced contraction. The inhibitory effects of catecholamines and clonidine were decreased by phentolamine (5.4 X 10(-6) M) and yohimbine (10(-7)-10(-6) M) but not by prazosin (7 X 10(-7)-10(-6) M). Nicotine (10(-6)-10(-4) M) and serotonin (3 X 10(-8)-3 X 10(-6) M) caused contraction of the intestinal bulb indirectly by releasing endogenous ACh. This contraction was inhibited by norepinephrine, epinephrine and clonidine in a concentration-dependent manner. The present results suggest that catecholamines and clonidine inhibit cholinergic transmission via the activation of a presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptor (presumably of alpha-2 type) located on the cholinergic nerve terminals innervating the smooth muscle of the intestinal bulb of the carp."
"Contractile response to norepinephrine, methoxamine and clonidine were determined in rat mesenteric arteries with and without an intact endothelium. Removal of the endothelial cell layer markedly enhanced the maximum contractile effect of norepinephrine (2.8 fold), methoxamine (4.0 fold) and clonidine (13.0 fold). Furthermore, there was a significant decrease in the EC50 values for these agonists. These findings indicate that both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists can induce contraction of mesenteric arteries which is modulated by the endothelial cell layer."
"Xylazine and clonidine, given intravenously, cause an increase in airway pressure in the anaesthetized, ventilated sheep. This increase was dose dependent and was not mediated by histamine, nor was it blocked by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. However, the increase was abolished by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, idazoxan. When the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists were administered into the cerebrospinal fluid by injection into the cisterna magna there was no increase in airway pressure, although a similar dose given peripherally still produced an effect. These findings would indicate that the increase in airway pressure seen in these sheep, following administration of xylazine and clonidine, was mediated by peripherally located alpha 2-adrenoceptors."
"In volume-expanded dogs receiving ethacrynic acid, a linear relationship, glomerulotubular balance (GTB), applies between the remaining sodium reabsorption and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) during mechanical aortic constriction. To examine whether GTB applies during sympathetic stimulation, the GFR was progressively reduced by 70-75\% in anaesthetized dogs by renal nerve stimulation, intrarenal norepinephrine infusion or by selective stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors by intrarenal methoxamine infusion. Linear relationships (GTB) were obtained (r greater than 0.9). Reabsorption was not different during the various kinds of sympathetic stimulation, but less than during aortic constriction; the largest difference in NaCl reabsorption at comparable GFR amounted to 10-15\% and was obtained 30-40\% below control GFR, whereas inhibition of NaHCO3 reabsorption was uncertain. To inhibit NaHCO3 reabsorption and associated NaCl reabsorption in the proximal tubules, acetazolamide (30 mg kg-1) was administered instead of ethacrynic acid. No difference in reabsorption was observed at comparable GFR during norepinephrine infusion and mechanical aortic constriction. Hence, GTB applies during sympathetic stimulation. Compared with data obtained during aortic constriction, alpha-adrenergic stimulation reduces proximal reabsorption of NaCl and, possibly, NaHCO3 and exerts no effect on distal transcellular NaCl reabsorption."
"Isolated kidney-cortical tubule suspensions and microdissected nephron segments from fed rats were used to study the action of catecholamines on gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis from rat tubule suspension incubated with 5 mM pyruvate was stimulated maximally by 10(-5) M methoxamine, an alpha 1-selective agonist, and 10(-6) M noradrenaline by 29.2 +/- 5.2\% (mean +/- SEM) and 32.6 +/- 2.9\%, respectively. These effects were completely inhibited by 10(-7) M prazosin, a beta 1-selective antagonist. Yohimbine, an alpha 2-antagonist, also inhibited the effect, but only at a higher concentration (5 X 10(-5) M). Gluconeogenesis was not stimulated by isoproterenol, a alpha-agonist, at any concentrations between 10(-5) and 10(-7) M. With microdissected nephron segments, only the proximal tubule possessed gluconeogenic activity. Within the proximal tubule, the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) revealed higher gluconeogenic activity than the proximal straight tubule (PST). Methoxamine at 10(-5) M stimulated gluconeogenesis in PCT, whereas in PST no increase of gluconeogenesis was observed. From these results, it can be concluded that an alpha 1-adrenergic agonist specifically stimulates renal gluconeogenesis in PCT, but not in PST."
"Four groups of mice were subjected to controlled fatal head trauma and then evaluated for the presence of ascites (neurogenic hyperacute ascites, NHA). The animals died virtually instantaneously and without evidence of maintained pain or suffering. The volume of ascites was determined in one group of animals. Two of the traumatized groups were pretreated, one with the beta-blocker propranolol and the other with the alpha-blocker phentolamine. A fifth, non-traumatized, group which was killed with either inhalation served as a control group. Two more groups of non-traumatized mice were administered either the alpha-adrenergic agonist methoxamine hydrochloride or the beta-agonist isoethrane mesylate before killing by ether inhalation, and then evaluated for ascites. Transudative ascitic fluid was found in 87-100\% of untreated traumatized mice and in no control animals. Pretreatment with phentolamine had no effect on the prevalence of ascites. Pretreatment with propranolol produced a significant decrease in the prevalence of ascites compared with trauma alone (P less than 0.001). Isoethrane (beta-agonist) administration caused ascites in 100\% of the treated animals. Methoxamine (alpha-agonist) administration did not cause ascites. A previously undescribed consequence of acute brain trauma is described (NHA) which appears to be mediated by beta-sympathetic activity of central origin. NHA is inhibited by beta-blockade and can be simulated with beta-agonist administration."
"Although alpha-adrenergic stimulation can increase coronary vascular resistance, it remains unknown whether the vasoconstriction can override intrinsic coronary regulatory influences to produce ischemia. Methoxamine, 2 to 4 mg, was infused into the circumflex coronary artery of 23 chloralose-anesthetized open chest dogs, and resulted in a 68\% increase in coronary vascular resistance. The functional consequence of this increased coronary vascular resistance was assessed by gated radionuclide ventriculography and ST-T wave changes on the electrocardiogram. In six dogs (Group I), aortic pressure changed trivially (less than 5 mm Hg) to allow distinction between direct effects of the flow reduction and indirect effects of increased aortic pressure. In this group, coronary blood flow decreased 33\% from a control value of 44 +/- 10 ml/min (p less than 0.001) and left ventricular ejection fraction decreased from 0.54 +/- 0.12 to 0.46 +/- 0.10 (p less than 0.025). In eight dogs (Group II) in which aortic pressure increased by more than 5 mm Hg, left ventricular ejection fraction decreased from 0.46 +/- 0.07 to 0.39 +/- 0.09 (p less than 0.002). Pressure gradients were measured between the aorta and a distal coronary artery branch to calculate small and large vessel resistances separately in four other dogs (Group III). The resistance of small coronary arteries accounted for 92\% of the total increase in coronary vascular resistance produced by methoxamine. In five other dogs (Group IV), intracoronary methoxamine, 2 mg, produced ST-T wave changes suggestive of ischemia as it increased coronary vascular resistance by 33\%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"The involvement of postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in the adrenergic constriction of the capacitance vessels was studied in anesthetized, spontaneously breathing dogs under ganglionic blockade (hexamethonium, 10 mg/kg + 10 mg/kg/hr; methylatropine, 0.5 mg/kg). Effective vascular compliance was measured as an indicator of venous tone (blood volume was varied by +/- 4 ml/kg in an 11-minute cycle of infusion, withdrawal, withdrawal, and reinfusion) and was calculated from the correlation between the observed changes in central venous pressure and the changes in blood volume. Sympathetic activity and central venous pressure were lower and effective vascular compliance was higher than values in untreated conscious dogs. The alpha 2-agonist UK 14,304 (5-bromo-6-[imidazolin-2-ylamino]-quinoxaline; 0.04 and 0.12 micrograms/kg/min; n = 6) dose-dependently lowered compliance and increased central venous pressure to levels found in conscious dogs, as did the alpha 1-agonist methoxamine (10 and 30 micrograms/kg; n = 6). Rauwolscine (alpha 2-antagonist), 0.3 mg/kg, significantly attenuated the effects of UK 14,304, but not those of methoxamine, while prazosin (alpha 1-antagonist), 0.12 mg/kg, attenuated the effects of methoxamine, but not those of UK 14,304 (n = 6 each). Under beta-blockade (nadolol, 2 mg/kg; n = 12) venous tone was increased to about physiological levels by norepinephrine, 0.15 micrograms/kg/min i.v., or by neuronal norepinephrine release induced by tyramine, 10 micrograms/kg/min i.v. These increases were significantly attenuated by prazosin as well as by rauwolscine and were abolished by a combination of both. These results indicate that postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenergic receptors (in addition to alpha 1-adrenergic receptors) are functional in the venous system in vivo and contribute substantially to adrenergic sympathetic and humoral regulation of venous tone."
"The effects of several alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists have been examined on tritium release elicited by electrical stimulation from isolated perfused SHR tail artery preparations prelabelled with 3H-noradrenaline (3H-NA). Phentolamine and yohimbine potently facilitated the stimulation evoked release of tritium at low frequencies of stimulation, but the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan was only weakly active at 1 mumol/l, despite antagonising the clonidine-evoked inhibition of 3H-release at a lower concentration of 0.1 mumol/l. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists prazosin and corynanthine also increased stimulation evoked tritium release in this preparation, suggesting the presence of prejunctional alpha 1-adrenoceptors. Furthermore, the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine (3 mumol/l) caused a significant inhibition of tritium-evoked release, an effect which was blocked by prazosin (10 nmol/l). When alpha 1-adrenoceptors were blocked in the presence of prazosin, idazoxan (0.1 mumol/l) produced a significant facilitatory effect on the electrically-evoked release of 3H-transmitter. On the other hand, when alpha 2-adrenoceptors were blocked in the presence of yohimbine, exposure to idazoxan (0.1 mumol/l) reduced significantly the stimulation-evoked release of tritium elicited by electrical stimulation. The results indicate that in the SHR tail arteries, idazoxan has a partial agonist inhibitory activity on transmitter release, which can mask the facilitatory effects due to blockade of presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors. The inhibitory effects of idazoxan appear to involve presynaptic alpha 1-adrenoceptors, which when stimulated, reduce 3H-NA release in SHR tail arteries."
"The influence of phenylephrine (PHE), methoxamine (MET) and ephedrine (EPH) on kininogen and prekallikrein level in plasma was investigated in male Wistar rats. Simultaneously the effect of these drugs on blood pressure was monitored. No changes in kininogenesis were observed during the hypertension period (2 h after ip injection). The significant decrease in kininogen level (by 20-30\%) was found 4 h after PHE (5 mg/kg) or EPH (40 mg/kg) and 4-12 h after MET (40 mg/kg) injection. The reduction of kallikrein utilization, indicating an increase in prekallikrein level in plasma, was noted only after PHE (by 34\%) or MET (by 44\%) administration. Phentolamine (REG) in a dose of 20 mg/kg, which counteracted the hypertensive effect of investigated drugs, abolished the influence of these drugs on kininogen level. The results indicate that the hypertension induced by alpha-adrenoceptor agonists evokes the delayed activation of kininogenesis parallel to the secondary decrease in blood pressure. Such a reaction of kinin system seems to be related to primary alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation, not to the direct influence of hypertensive drugs on kinin system in rat plasma."
"Effects of nicorandil on contractile responses to alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists were examined in isolated rabbit aorta. Nicorandil (10(-6) or 10(-5) M) inhibited contractile responses to clonidine (CL) and BHT-920 in a concentration-dependent manner, but had no effect on the response to methoxamine (MO). Nifedipine (10(-6) and 10(-5) M) had no significant effect on responses to CL and MO, but it had a noticeable inhibitory effect on the response to BHT-920. In tissues pretreated with phenoxybenzamine, nicorandil (10(-5) M) inhibited the residual response to MO, and nifedipine (10(-5) M) inhibited responses to MO and CL. The relationship between maximum contraction and percent receptor occupancy was found to be nonlinear for MO, but was near linear for CL and BHT-920. The inhibitory effect of prazosin (pA2 of about 9) on MO and CL was much greater than that of yohimbine (pA2 of about 6). Nicorandil had no apparent or slight inhibitory effect on responses to potassium and Ca2+, and this inhibitory effect was much less than that of nifedipine. These results indicate that the responses induced by MO, CL, and BHT-920 in the rabbit aorta are due to activation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors. It is also suggested that nicorandil minimally affects voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx and that differential effects of nicorandil on the responses to alpha 1 and alpha 2 agonists may be the result of differences in the amount of receptor reserve that exist for MO, CL, and BHT-920 in this blood vessel."
"The effects of vasoactive substances on mean circulatory filling pressure (MCFP), an index of total body venous tone, were determined in conscious rats. Cumulative doses of saline (0.9\% w/v NaCl solution), methoxamine (alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist), B-HT920 (alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist) noradrenaline and vasopressin, and individual doses of angiotensin II (AII), were infused into the rats. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), MCFP and heart rate (HR) were determined before and during the plateau responses to infusions of the vasoactive substances. The infusions of all the agonists caused a dose-dependent increase in MAP and a decrease in HR. The infusion of saline affected neither MAP nor HR. The infusions of saline and methoxamine did not affect MCFP while the infusions of B-HT 920, noradrenaline and AII increased MCFP. MCFP was slightly increased during the infusion of high doses of vasopressin. It was concluded that receptors for the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist and AII are involved in the control of venous tone. Receptors for the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist and vasopressin are not important for the control of venous tone."
"Alpha-1 adrenergic receptors were examined in rat caudal artery using radioligand binding of [125I]labeled BE 2254 (125IBE) and in vitro contraction measurements. 125IBE bound rapidly and reversibly to a single class of high affinity binding sites in membrane preparations of caudal artery. Scatchard analysis gave an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 110 pM and a density of binding sites of 115 fmol/mg of protein. Antagonists inhibited 125IBE binding and phenylephrine-induced contractions competitively, with an order of potency of prazosin greater than ARC 239 greater than phentolamine greater than yohimbine. pA2 values for inhibition of phenylephrine-induced contraction correlated well with KD values for inhibition of specific 125IBE binding. A number of other full and partial agonists also caused contraction of caudal arteries with an order of potency of epinephrine greater than norepinephrine greater than phenylephrine greater than methoxamine. The order of potency of agonists and the potencies of antagonists suggests that the contractile responses of rat caudal artery were mediated by alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. The EC50 values of partial agonists in causing contraction correlated well with their KD values for inhibition of specific 125IBE binding. However, the EC50 values for full agonists were 30 to 200 times lower than their KD values. Treatment of caudal arteries in vitro with 0.1 microM phenoxybenzamine for 10 min to inactivate alpha adrenergic receptors decreased both the potency of full agonists in causing contraction and the maximal contractile response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Contractile responses to single or cumulative doses of alpha-adrenoceptor agonists were compared in the tail artery and the saphenous vein of the rat. In the rat tail artery, there were no differences in the dose-response relationships to noradrenaline, methoxamine, and KCl whether the agonists were applied as single or cumulative doses. However, the responses to single doses of clonidine and B-HT 920 were significantly larger than similar doses applied cumulatively. In the rat saphenous vein, responses to single doses of noradrenaline, clonidine, and B-HT 920 were also significantly larger than the corresponding cumulative doses. However, there was no difference in the responses to KCl. It was suggested that desensitization of alpha 2-adrenoceptors in these vessels may result in the diminished responses to cumulative doses of the agonists. Desensitization appeared to be specific to alpha 2-adrenoceptors, since the effect was not observed in responses mediated by the alpha 1-adrenoceptors and KCl."
"Adrenaline (0.1-10 micrograms/kg), noradrenaline (0.1-10 micrograms/kg) and phenylephrine (1-100 micrograms/kg) acted on both cardiac alpha 1- and beta-adrenoreceptors to induce positive chronotropic responses in the pithed rat. When beta-adrenoreceptors were blocked by propranolol (1 mg/kg), the residual chronotropic responses were due to activation of alpha 1-adrenoreceptors since they were significantly reduced by prazosin (10-100 micrograms/kg). Methoxamine (10-300 micrograms/kg) acted solely on cardiac alpha 1-adrenoreceptors to induce positive chronotropic responses which were abolished by prazosin (10-100 micrograms/kg) alone, as has been demonstrated previously for amidephrine. The rank order of potency for eliciting the positive chronotropic response to alpha 1-adrenoreceptor activation was adrenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than phenylephrine greater than methoxamine. The positive chronotropic responses to adrenaline (3-10 micrograms/kg), noradrenaline (3-10 micrograms/kg) and phenylephrine (30-100 micrograms/kg) produced by activating alpha 1-adrenoreceptors had a slower time course than did the chronotropic responses produced by activation of beta-adrenoreceptors."
"Studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of celiprolol on alpha-adrenergic stimulation of dog saphenous vein rings (postsynaptic effect) and on catecholamine outflow from the dog coronary circulation during sympathetic nerve stimulation in vivo (presynaptic effect). In venous rings, celiprolol, 10(-6) to 10(-4) M, shifted the concentration-response curve to BHT 920 in a concentration-related manner, but had no effect on the response to methoxamine at concentrations less than 10(-4) M. During continuous stimulation of the right stellate ganglion, celiprolol, 1-10 mg/kg i.v., increased the catecholamine concentration in the coronary sinus, while decreasing heart rate. In contrast, propranolol did not affect catecholamine concentration but decreased heart rate, rauwolscine increased both catecholamine concentration and heart rate, and clonidine decreased both catecholamine concentration and heart rate. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that celiprolol possesses weak alpha 2-antagonist properties in addition to its beta 1-blocking activity."
"The aim of this study was to evaluate whether in infant rats, as in adult rats, the brain adrenergic mechanisms regulate plasma GH levels and, if so, to determine the contribution of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) and/or somatostatin (SS) pathways. In 10-day-old rats, activation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors by clonidine (CLO) was effective to stimulate GH release starting from 50 micrograms/kg ip and up to 450 micrograms/kg ip, though no dose-related effect was evident. Conversely, alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade by yohimbine (YOH, 10 mg/kg, ip) decreased baseline GH levels. Administration of methoxamine (METHOX, 10 micrograms/rat, ip), a alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, significantly reduced plasma GH concentrations, while prazosin (5 mg/kg BW, ip), a specific alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, stimulated plasma GH secretion. Administration of an anti-SS serum (SS-ab, 300 microliters, ip) induced a significant rise in plasma GH levels, while administration of an anti-GHRH serum (GHRH-ab, 100 microliters, ip) was associated with a striking fall in GH levels. In rats pretreated with SS-ab, administration of CLO induced a further rise in plasma GH levels. GHRH-ab significantly reduced plasma GH levels, and this effect was not altered by subsequent CLO administration. Administration of SS-ab and YOH resulted in plasma GH levels intermediate between those of rats treated with SS-ab alone or YOH alone, while pretreatment with GHRH-ab induced a lowering of plasma GH greater than when YOH was given alone. in rats pretreated with SS-ab, the GH-lowering effect of METHOX was completely lacking, while GHRH-ab and METHOX induced a lowering of plasma GH similar to that ensuing after METHOX alone or GHRH-ab alone. Administration of prazosin in rats pretreated with SS-ab did not elicit any further rise in plasma GH, while combined administration with GHRH-ab elicited a GH-lowering effect comparable to that elicited by GHRH-ab alone. These data demonstrate that in the infant rat: brain adrenergic mechanisms involved in the neural regulation of GH secretion are operative; different neuropeptide mechanisms mediate the effect of activation or inhibition of alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors. In particular, activation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors stimulates GH secretion via endogenous GHRH release, although a mechanism operating to inhibit hypothalamic SS release cannot be excluded; stimulation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors is inhibitory to GH secretion exclusively via an increased release of hypothalamic SS."
"The effects of adrenergic agonists and adenosine on the accumulation of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) were examined in cerebral cortical slices from adult and neonatal rats. Methoxamine (10 to 100 microM) produced up to a two-fold increase in tissue from adult animals only in the presence of optimal concentrations of adenosine (40 to 100 microM), but had no effect in neonatal tissue. Such responses were inhibited more readily by prazosin than by yohimbine, but the reverse was true for responses to norepinephrine; when tested without the addition of adenosine, however, responses to norepinephrine were somewhat more sensitive to prazosin. Under the latter conditions, norepinephrine induced about twice as much increase in cyclic AMP as did isoproterenol in adult tissue. While always prevented by alpha-adrenergic antagonists, the greater efficacy of norepinephrine was eliminated by methylxanthines only in some instances, but never in tissue from animals known to be less than 60 days of age. At 11 to 15 days of age, responses to norepinephrine were more than fourfold those to isoproterenol, even in the presence of methylxanthines, and were completely suppressed by propranolol. Responses to isoproterenol were enhanced when tested in the presence of adenosine, especially in neonatal tissue. The results suggest that both endogenous adenosine and age-related phenomena may account for some of the discrepancies among earlier studies. Moreover, they indicate that several populations of alpha-adrenergic receptors may be involved in responses to adrenergic agonists in rat cerebral cortical tissue."
"Calcium channel blocking agents preferentially antagonize alpha 2-mediated pressor responses in various animal species. Whether the same happens in man is not clear. For this reason we studied the interference exerted by verapamil, a calcium entry blocker, on forearm vasoconstriction mediated by selective alpha 1- (methoxamine) and alpha 2- (B-HT 933) adrenergic agonists in untreated mild-to-moderately hypertensive patients (n = 22). Each patient underwent a single study. Forearm blood flow was recorded by strain gauge venous plethysmography; all drugs were infused into the brachial artery at systemically ineffective rates. Cumulative dose-response curves to intra-arterial methoxamine or B-HT 933 were obtained during saline or two different rates of verapamil infusion (0.9 and 3.1 micrograms/100 ml forearm tissue per min) which increased forearm blood flow dose-dependently without changing systemic blood pressure or heart rate. Either methoxamine or B-HT 933 decreased forearm blood flow during saline infusion, but their effect was blunted in a dose-dependent manner during verapamil. No evidence of preferential alpha 2-antagonism was present. At variance with animal data, calcium entry blockade by verapamil antagonizes either alpha 1- or alpha 2-mediated vasoconstriction in human forearm vessels."
"Positive inotropic responses to selective alpha-adrenoceptor agonists of isolated paced left atria and chronotropic responses of isolated spontaneously beating right atria of rats were examined. After establishing a cumulative concentration-response curve to isoprenaline, and washout, a concentration-response curve for phenylephrine, methoxamine, cirazoline, amidephrine or UK 14,304 was constructed in the presence of beta-adrenoceptor blockade by propranolol. The 4 alpha 1-selective agonists produced positive inotropic responses, the order of maximum effectiveness being methoxamine greater than phenylephrine greater than cirazoline greater than amidephrine. In terms of EC50 values, methoxamine was the least potent, the other 3 agonists having approximately equivalent potencies. The alpha 2-selective agonist UK 14,304 had no inotropic activity. Weak positive chronotropic activity occurred with phenylephrine, methoxamine and amidephrine; cirazoline exerted only negative chronotropy and UK 14,304 was without effect. Phenylephrine was examined in the absence or presence of prazosin (3 nM) or propranolol (1 microM). Propranolol failed to affect the concentration-response curve for left atrial tension, but prazosin displaced the curve to the right. This indicates that the inotropic responses obtained in the absence of antagonists were mediated solely via alpha-adrenoceptors. After displacement by prazosin there was a further shift by propranolol, suggesting the presence of a beta-adrenoceptor-mediated component at higher concentrations of phenylephrine. The right atrial rate responses to phenylephrine were unaffected by prazosin, but abolished by propranolol; beta-adrenoceptors only are therefore involved in this response. The pA2 values for antagonism of methoxamine-induced increases in left atrial tension by the alpha 1- and alpha 2-selective antagonists prazosin (9.05 +/- 0.06) and idazoxan (6.37 +/- 0.05), respectively, were consistent with the responses being mediated via alpha-adrenoceptors of the alpha 1-subtype. The pA2 value for prazosin was similar to that obtained for antagonism of methoxamine-induced contractions of rat aortic spirals (8.83 +/- 0.13)."
"The behavioural and electrocortical (ECoG) effects of clonidine were studied after microinjection into the third cerebral ventricle, or microinfusion into some specific areas of the rat brain rich in noradrenaline-containing cell bodies (locus coeruleus) or into areas receiving noradrenergic terminals (dorsal hippocampus, amygdaloid complex, thalamus, frontal and sensimotor cortex). The ECoG effects were continuously analysed and quantified by means of a Berg-Fourier analyser as total power and as power in preselected bands of frequency. Clonidine (9.4 to 75 nmol) given into the third cerebral ventricle produced behavioural sedation and sleep and a dose-dependent increase in ECoG total voltage power as well as in the lower frequency bands. Much lower doses were required to produce similar behavioural and ECoG spectrum power effects after either unilateral or bilateral microinfusion of clonidine into the locus coeruleus. Doses of clonidine equimolar to those given into the third cerebral ventricle, were almost ineffective in inducing behavioural and ECoG sleep after their microinfusion into the dorsal hippocampus. In addition, a dose (0.56 nmol) of clonidine which, given into the locus coeruleus, produced marked behavioural sleep and ECoG synchronization, lacked effects when given into the ventral or anterior thalamus, into the amygdaloid complex or onto the frontal and sensimotor cortex. The behavioural and ECoG spectrum power effects of clonidine given into the third cerebral ventricle or into the locus coeruleus were prevented by antagonists of alpha 2-adrenoceptors but not by alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists. Intraventricular microinjection, or microinfusion into the locus coeruleus, of yohimbine, a selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, produced behavioural arousal, increase in locomotor and exploratory activity, tachypnoea and ECoG desynchronization with a significant reduction in total voltage power. Similar stimulatory effects were also observed after microinjection of phentolamine into the same sites. No significant effects on behaviour and ECoG activity were evoked after intraventricular injection or microinfusion into the locus coeruleus of prazosin or methoxamine."
"This study was undertaken to assess the effects of exogenous alpha-agonists on the effector response to transmural nerve stimulation in canine saphenous vein rings. The response to a fixed train (5 s duration) of transmural nerve stimulation (8 Hz, 0.3 ms, 9 V) applied every 5 min was determined in the control state and in the presence of subthreshold (for contraction) concentrations of noradrenaline, adrenaline, clonidine, and methoxamine. The maximum potentiations achieved by the three drugs were 246.2 +/- 36.9, 220.5 +/- 38.8, 384.3 +/- 78.7, and 353.3 +/- 68.0\%, respectively. The potentiation observed was significantly inhibited by indomethacin (10(-6) mol/L) and propranolol (5 X 10(-6) mol/L). Both indomethacin and propranolol potentiated the response to transmural nerve stimulation. The potentiation of the responses to transmural nerve stimulation by alpha-agonists suggests that, presynaptic alpha 2-inhibition by circulating catecholamines is likely to be of limited biological significance in modulating the effector responses in the canine saphenous vein."
"The exo- and endo-2-amino-5,8-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1,4-epoxynaphthalenes++ + (3b and 4b, respectively) were prepared and evaluated as conformationally defined analogues of the alpha 1-agonist methoxamine. Only compound 3b exhibited significant alpha 1-agonist activity in the field stimulated rat vas deferens assay. Since 3b closely approximates the antiperiplanar form of (1R,2S)-(-)-erythro-methoxamine, the results suggest that methoxamine interacts with the alpha 1-adrenoceptor in the trans extended form. The exo-guanidino derivative 5 was found to be a partial alpha 1-agonist. Among the exo- and endo-2-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1,4-epoxynaphthalenes (3a and 4a, respectively) prepared as rigid analogues of norephedrine, compound 3a possessed agonist activity at both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors, whereas 4a was inactive at either receptor."
"The benzoquinolizines Wy 25309, Wy 26703 and Wy 27127, previously reported as potent antagonists at presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors were also potent antagonists of B-HT 933 in isolated saphenous veins of the dog confirming their activity at post synaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Yohimbine was a more potent antagonist of B-HT 933 in isolated saphenous vein than were the Wy compounds or idazoxan contrasting with the reported potencies of these compounds at presynaptic sites in rat vas deferens and raising the possibility of differences between pre- and postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Contractions of the saphenous vein were observed with high concentrations of idazoxan."
"This study characterizes the maturational change of cardiac function in unanaesthetized lambs from 1 day to 6 months of age. The cardiac function curve, the relationship between left ventricular output (Qco) and left ventricular end diastolic pressure, was studied in lambs of ages 1 day, 2-3 days, 7-8 days, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. Cardiac output was measured by thermodilution while left ventricular end diastolic pressure was either raised by infusion of 5\% glucose, or lowered by haemorrhage. At elevated left ventricular end diastolic pressure, cardiac output tended to reach a plateau of approximately 300 ml/min per kg in lambs less than 1 week of age and 200 ml/min per kg in lambs older than 1 month. Cardiac function was depressed by total ganglionic block in 1-3 days-old lambs, but not in lambs older than 1 week. Heart rate decreased in response to ganglionic block in lambs up to 1 week of age, but it increased in lambs 3-6 months old. Increases in afterload with methoxamine infusion during ganglionic block further depressed cardiac function in all age groups of lambs. The stroke work curve was shifted downward by hexamethonium and returned back to control level by methoxamine. We conclude that newborn cardiac output is near maximum even at 1 month of age. Sympathetic activity and circulating catecholamines help maintain cardiac function in 1-3 days-old lambs. Cardiac function is sensitive to afterload in lambs of all ages studied."
"In dog saphenous vein--a tissue possessing both postsynaptic alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors--the effects of two selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists (phenylephrine and methoxamine) were compared with that of the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, UK-14,304, before and after phenoxybenzamine. Furthermore, the influence exerted by prazosin, yohimbine and verapamil on the effects of these agonists was also studied before and after phenoxybenzamine. In the absence of phenoxybenzamine, prazosin (56 nmol/l) caused a parallel shift of the concentration-response curves of both phenylephrine and methoxamine to the right (by 0.94 and 1.1 log units, respectively) and had no effect on the concentration-response curve of UK-14,304, while 20 nmol/l yohimbine caused a marked parallel shift of the concentration-response curve of UK-14,304 to the right (by 1.18 log units) and caused only minor displacements of those of phenylephrine and methoxamine (by 0.2 and 0.33 log units, respectively). After exposure of the strips to 30 nmol/l phenoxybenzamine, prazosin (56 nmol/l) caused small shifts of the concentration-response curves of both phenylephrine (by 0.36 log units) and methoxamine (by 0.31 log units) and did not change that of UK-14,304, while yohimbine (20 nmol/l) caused pronounced parallel shifts of the concentration-response curves (to the right) of all the agonists: phenylephrine (by 1.0 log units), methoxamine (by 0.93 log units) and UK-14,304 (by 1.28 log units).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"The alpha-adrenergic agonists phenylephrine and methoxamine, at concentrations that have little effect on pineal N-acetyltransferase activity, markedly enhance stimulation of this enzyme by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). This augmentation can be blocked by the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonists phenoxybenzamine and prazosin and, at 10 but not 1 microM, by the alpha 2-antagonist yohimbine. The time course for VIP stimulation is not altered by concomitant alpha-adrenergic stimulation. Augmented activity does not require concomitant alpha-adrenergic stimulation, but alpha-adrenergic agonists must be present for augmentation to be maintained. Phorbol 12,13-diacetate or -dibutyrate but not 4 alpha-phorbol can substitute for phenylephrine, a finding suggesting that protein kinase C is involved in the augmentation. These results are, in general, analogous to alpha-adrenergic magnification of N-acetyltransferase induction by beta-adrenergic agonists."
"These studies examine whether alpha 1-noradrenergic receptor stimulation alone is sufficient to facilitate lordosis behavior in ovariectomized, estrogen-primed female guinea pigs and to what extent alpha 2-noradrenergic receptors are involved in this steroid-dependent behavior. Neither of the alpha 1-agonists, phenylephrine or methoxamine, significantly facilitated lordosis in ovariectomized females primed with 10 micrograms of estradiol benzoate for 1 or 3 days. Animals exhibiting estrogen plus clonidine-facilitated lordosis showed a decrease in the behavior when given one of two alpha 2-antagonists (yohimbine or idazoxan). Idazoxan also attenuated lordosis in animals given estrogen plus progesterone. These findings, in combination with previous findings (that specific alpha 1-antagonists block lordosis), suggest that alpha 2-receptors, in addition to alpha 1-receptors play a role in modulation of lordosis behavior."
"The effects of potassium (K+) and adrenoceptor agonists on 45Ca influx and contraction of isolated vas deferens from reserpine-treated guinea-pigs has been investigated. K+ (18-84 mM) increased 45Ca influx with the maximum influx occurring at 50 mM K+. The rate of influx upon exposure to K+ was highest in the first 2 min and decreased thereafter. In contrast to K+, norepinephrine, methoxamine and xylazine did not increase the rate of 45Ca influx. Norepinephrine and methoxamine, but not xylazine, inhibited 45Ca influx induced by high K+. The inhibitory effect of norepinephrine was also present in denervated tissues. Prazosin, but not yohimbine or propranolol, blocked the inhibitory effect of norepinephrine. Potassium-induced contractions were significantly potentiated in the presence of norepinephrine, especially at low calcium concentrations. We conclude that K+ contracts the guinea-pig vas deferens by increasing the influx of calcium whereas stimulation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors prevents 45Ca influx elicited by high potassium."
"Using the cannula inserting method, we investigated the responsiveness of isolated skeletal muscle branches of the dog femoral artery to alpha-adrenoceptor agonists and potassium chloride, and the influence of cold storage (3 days and 5-7 days, at 4 degrees C). Epinephrine (EPI) and norepinephrine (NE) induced a marked vasoconstriction in a dose-related manner. A large dose of EPI and NE usually induced an increase in perfusion pressure of more than 100-200 mm Hg. Phenylephrine (PE) and methoxamine (MT) also induced a marked constriction, but clonidine (CLO) and xylazine (XYL) produced only a slight vasoconstriction, even in large doses. Tyramine (TYR) also induced a small vasoconstrictor response. A large dose of KCl induced a marked vasoconstriction. The order of potency of constriction was EPI greater than or equal to NE greater than PE = MT much greater than KCl greater than CLO greater than or equal to TYR greater than or equal to XYL. The vasoconstrictor responses to EPI and NE were significantly suppressed by 3-7 days of cold storage. Vasoconstrictor responses to MT were slightly suppressed by cold storage. However, XYL-, CLO- and TYR-induced vasoconstrictions were not significantly influenced by cold storage. KCl-induced constriction was clearly suppressed by cold storage. These observations suggest that the postjunctional alpha-adrenoceptor in skeletal muscle branches of the femoral artery is of the alpha 1-type. Moreover, it was shown that prolonged cold storage (3-7 days, at 4 degrees C) resulted in a decrease in sensitivity of these vessels to alpha-adrenoceptor agonists and in a marked decrease in sensitivity to KCl, suggesting a depression of the calcium channel by cold storage."
"The activities of the alpha-1 antagonist prazosin and alpha-2 antagonist yohimbine were evaluated against noradrenaline (NA), methoxamine (Me) and clonidine (Clo) on the reserpinized rat vas deferens. Prazosin antagonized competitively Me but not NA and Clo. On the other hand yohimbine showed a low and not competitive antagonism towards all the three agonists. Similar results were obtained when the antagonistic activities were tested in the presence of the alternative antagonist, in the attempt to isolate a single receptor population. We can conclude that the smooth musculature of the rat vas deferens contains prevalently alpha-1 adrenoceptors and a small population of NA activated receptors resistant to alpha-2 antagonists."
"The endogenous role of the alpha-adrenergic system in the maintenance of mean arterial pressure (MAP), total peripheral resistance (TPR), cardiac output (CO) and its distribution, and plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine release was investigated by the administration of selective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists to halothane-anesthetized rats. The blockade of alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and both alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptors was accomplished by i.v. infusions of prazosin, rauwolscine, and phentolamine, respectively. The microsphere technique was used for the determination of CO and its distribution. Since the infusions of the three antagonists caused similar decreases of MAP and heart rate, the results suggest that postjunctional alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptors are both important in the control of MAP. During the infusion of prazosin, TPR was decreased but CO was not changed. In contrast, CO was decreased but TPR was not changed during the infusions of rauwolscine and phentolamine. Thus, CO was reduced after the blockade of alpha 2- but not alpha 1-receptors. All three antagonists caused an increase in percent distribution of CO to the lungs and muscle, suggesting that the sympathetic nervous system plays the greatest vasoconstrictor influence in the lungs and muscle via stimulations of both subtypes of alpha-adrenoceptors. The administration of either prazosin or rauwolscine caused little change in plasma catecholamine levels. In contrast, phentolamine caused large increases in both epinephrine and norepinephrine levels. Therefore catecholamine release was only increased after concurrent blockade of both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors."
"Current information suggests that alpha 2-adrenoceptors do not directly influence vascular resistance or Na reabsorption in the rat kidney. To reexamine the effects of alpha 2-agonists we used isolated rat kidneys perfused at 37.5 degrees C with precise measurement of renal artery pressure and flow. The recirculating perfusate contained pyruvate as the sole metabolic substrate which enabled us to use gluconeogenesis as an index of proximal tubular alpha 1-responses. Clonidine and guanfacine in 100 nM concentrations decreased phosphate excretion without altering Na, Cl, or K reabsorption or gluconeogenesis; 500 nM concentrations increased vascular resistance and decreased glomerular filtration rate and Na, Cl, and K excretion with no significant effect on gluconeogenesis. Prior thyroparathyroidectomy prevented the antiphosphaturic but not the antinatriuretic or vascular responses. Clonidine, an alpha 2-agonist with some alpha 1-activity, was a more potent vasoconstrictor than methoxamine or guanfacine. In the presence of prazosin (1 microM), norepinephrine (60 nM) stimulated phosphate reabsorption; norepinephrine alone did not stimulate phosphate reabsorption which indicates alpha 1-antagonism of this alpha 2-response to NE. These results and a literature review suggest that increased renal alpha 2-adrenoceptors could raise renal vascular resistance, reduce renin secretion, and antagonize parathyroid hormone effects on Pi, Ca, HCO3, and Na reabsorption to produce a low renin type of hypertension with increased proximal Na reabsorption and abnormal Ca and Pi excretion."
"Methoxamine and alpha-methyl-noradrenaline were administered to six healthy male subjects on separate days as rapid bolus injections until blood pressure increased by approximately 30 mmHg; Valsalva's Manoeuvre was carried out on each occasion. Propranolol (80 mg) or placebo was administered (random order, double-blind, weekly intervals) and the observations were repeated after 2 h. Baroreceptor sensitivity (delta R-R interval ms/mmHg systolic BP) was less (p less than 0.05) with alpha-methyl-noradrenaline than methoxamine. Propranolol abolished the differences in baroreceptor-mediated bradycardia following alpha-methyl-noradrenaline and methoxamine, and shifted the baroreceptor sensitivity regression lines (p less than 0.05) to the left. During the release phase of Valsalva's Manoeuvre baroreceptor sensitivity was increased following propranolol. The smaller baroreceptor-mediated bradycardia response observed with alpha-methyl-noradrenaline does not support the hypothesis that pre-synaptic alpha-adrenoreceptors have a physiological role in the modulation of baroreceptor function in man, and may be due to alpha-methyl-noradrenaline having beta 1-agonist activity."
"The effect of diltiazem on vasoconstrictor responses was investigated in the feline mesenteric vascular bed under conditions of controlled blood flow. Diltiazem inhibited vasoconstrictor responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation, tyramine and norepinephrine suggesting that responses to both nerve-released and exogenous norepinephrine are dependent in part on an extracellular source of calcium. The calcium entry antagonist inhibited vasoconstrictor responses to alpha 1 and to alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonists over a wide range of concentration. Diltiazem also inhibited mesenteric vasoconstrictor responses to angiotensin II, vasopressin, prostaglandin F2 alpha and KCl. The inhibitor effects of diltiazem on vasoconstrictor responses to nerve stimulation and the pressor agents were reversible, and all responses returned to control value 30 to 45 min after the infusion of the calcium entry antagonist. The present data suggest that the inhibitory effects of diltiazem on responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation are postjunctional in nature, as responses to nerve-released and exogenous norepinephrine and nonadrenergic pressor agents are reduced to a similar extent. The present results suggest that vasoconstrictor responses to neuronally released and exogenous norepinephrine, as well as agents which activate membrane receptors or depolarize vascular smooth muscle in the feline mesenteric vascular bed, are dependent in part on an extracellular source of calcium. The inhibitory effects of diltiazem on vasoconstrictor responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation and pressor hormones may be relevant to the antihypertensive actions of this calcium entry antagonist."
"Vascular adrenergic responses were examined in the hindlimb perfused with blood at constant flow using pentobarbital-anesthetized male Fischer 344 rats aged 6, 12, 20, and 24 mo. The increase in hindlimb perfusion pressure to lumbar sympathetic nerve stimulation was significantly smaller in 20- and 24-mo-old rats than in younger animals, whereas vasoconstrictor responses to intraarterial administration of norepinephrine, L-phenylephrine, and methoxamine were reduced only in the 24-mo-old animals. Thus neurogenic vasoconstriction in the hindlimb is reduced at 20 mo of age, whereas there is a more generalized postjunctional loss of adrenergic responsiveness at 24 mo. In the presence of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, vasoconstrictor responses to exogenous norepinephrine did not differ when 12- and 20-mo-old animals were compared. Furthermore, in the presence of propranolol the nerve-mediated rise in hindlimb perfusion pressure also did not differ in 12- and 20-mo-old rats. Blockade of neuronal norepinephrine uptake with cocaine produced a greater potentiation of vasoconstrictor responses to both nerve stimulation and exogenous norepinephrine in the older rats. Therefore, the reduced nerve-mediated vasoconstriction in 20-mo-old rats may be due to neuronal activation of beta-adrenoceptors as well as enhanced neuronal norepinephrine reuptake."
"This study examines the arrhythmogenic action of alpha 1 and alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulation in the isolated perfused rat heart. The alpha 1-agonist methoxamine in the presence of the beta 1-antagonist atenolol 10(-6) M decreased the ventricular fibrillation threshold in the normoxic rat ventricular myocardium: VFT values (mA): Control 11.2 +/- 0.5; methoxamine 10(-6) M 4.9 +/- 0.9 (P less than 0.01 vs control); methoxamine 10(-5) M 3.5 +/- 0.5 (P less than 0.01 vs control). The alpha 1-antagonist prazosin 10(-8) M prevented the methoxamine-induced fall in ventricular fibrillation threshold. The alpha 2-agonist BHT 933 (azepexole) in the presence of atenolol 10(-6) M produced no alteration in the ventricular fibrillation threshold. Methoxamine 10(-6) M to 10(-5) M had a positive inotropic effect with increased left ventricular pressure development, myocardial oxygen consumption and QT-interval; however, tissue levels of cyclic AMP remained unchanged. Methoxamine 10(-6) M did not alter heart rate, coronary flow rate or deplete tissue levels of adenosine triphosphate, phosphocreatine or glycogen. The enhanced vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation induced by methoxamine could be demonstrated only at supraphysiological extracellular calcium concentrations (2.5 mM) but not at physiological calcium concentrations (1.25 mM). The arrhythmogenic and inotropic effect of methoxamine 10(-6) M was prevented by inhibition of transsarcolemmal Ca2+ ion influx by nisoldipine 10(-8) M or by inhibition of release of Ca2+ from sarcoplasmic reticulum by ryanodine 10(-9) M to 10(-8) M. Thus in isolated normoxic rat heart preparations, activity of the alpha 1-receptor appears to mediate ventricular arrhythmogenesis but only in the setting of myocardial calcium overload. The arrhythmogenic effect of alpha 1-stimulation may be due to increased transsarcolemmal calcium influx and enhanced release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum; increased myocardial oxygen consumption secondary to greater left ventricular pressure development may contribute in part."
"Removal of the endothelium from isolated perfused rat caudal arteries produced a two fold increase in the contractile response to transmural nerve stimulation. Pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine eliminated the contractile response to adrenergic nerve stimulation but failed to uncover any vasodilatory effect of electrical stimulation, either directly on smooth muscle or via non-adrenergic nerves. Endothelial removal also produced two and four fold enhancement of the contractile responses to the selective alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists methoxamine and B-HT 920. However, pKB values for prazosin and yohimbine versus both agonists indicate that both methoxamine and B-HT 920 are acting primarily at alpha 1-adrenoceptors in this tissue. These results provide evidence that endothelial factors released either at basal levels or by the stimulation of agonists play a significant physiological role in modifying the contractile responses of blood vessels."
"In the autoperfused hindlimb of pithed rats, vasoconstrictor responses to intra-arterial infusions of the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, B-HT 933, were antagonized by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, rauwolscine (1 mg/kg i.v.), and by the selective postjunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, SK&F 104078 (1 mg/kg), but not by the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (0.1 mg/kg). In contrast, responses to the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, methoxamine, were antagonized by prazosin, but not by rauwolscine or SK&F 104078. Vasopressor responses to stimulation of sympathetic nerves were inhibited by prazosin, increased by rauwolscine, and not affected by SK&F 104078. The results indicate that vascular neuroeffector transmission in rat hindlimb is mediated by postjunctional alpha 1-adrenoceptors, and that SK&F 104078 is a selective antagonist of postjunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptor, and lacks the prejunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist action of rauwolscine."
"The vasoinhibitory effects of MCI-154 (MCI), a new pyridazione derivative, on contractile responses to alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists were examined in isolated rabbit aorta. MCI (10(-8)-10(-5) M) inhibited the maximum contractile responses to clonidine and BHT-920 (BHT) in a concentration-dependent manner, but only inhibited responses to lower concentrations of methoxamine. In aortas pretreated with phenoxybenzamine however, MCI (10(-5) M) readily inhibited responses to methoxamine. MCI (10(-5) M) had no significant effect on responses to potassium or added Ca2+ in a Ca2+ free, K+-depolarizing medium. In aortas incubated in a Ca2+-free medium with EGTA, the addition of methoxamine (10(-5) M), clonidine (10(-5) M) or BHT (3 X 10(-4) M) induced a phasic contraction. The inhibitory effect of MCI (10(-9)-10(-5) M) on these phasic responses was much greater for clonidine or BHT than for methoxamine. In rabbit iliac artery caffeine (10 mM) induced a rapid phasic contraction in a Ca2+-free medium, which was inhibited by MCI (10(-7)-10(-5) M) in a concentration-dependent manner. In aortas incubated in a Ca2+-free medium with low EGTA and nifedipine (10(-6) M) in the presence of alpha-adrenoceptor agonists (methoxamine, clonidine or BHT), the addition of Ca2+ (2 mM) induced a tonic contraction. MCI (10(-8)-10(-5) M) inhibited these Ca2+-dependent, agonists-mediated responses in a concentration-dependent manner. MCI had no effect on unstimulated La3+ resistant Ca2+ binding or methoxamine-induced Ca2+ influx.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"The effects of microiontophoresis of norepinephrine and epinephrine were examined on the spontaneous neuronal activity of single neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in urethan-anesthetized rats. Neuronal responses to catecholamine iontophoresis were examined in the absence and presence of the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, prazosin, and the alpha 2-antagonist, idazoxan, to characterize the subtypes of alpha-adrenergic receptors mediating catecholamine action in this important autonomic nucleus. Norepinephrine produced inhibitions in firing, which were blocked primarily by idazoxan, whereas epinephrine-induced neuronal inhibitions were blocked by either prazosin or idazoxan. Inhibitions of spontaneous firing were also produced by iontophoresis of methoxamine, an alpha 1-selective agonist, or the alpha 2-selective agonist clonidine in all neurons that were tested. Neuronal responses to methoxamine were blocked selectively by prazosin, whereas the effects of clonidine were antagonized selectively by idazoxan. These data provide evidence at the level of the single unit that catecholamines may affect activity in the NTS via interactions with both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors."
"To determine the site of reperfusion damage after ischaemia the leakage of xanthine dehydrogenase and xanthine oxidase was assessed in vascular and interstitial effluents. Contractile function was reduced during hypoperfusion but improved after the addition of superoxide dismutase and vasoxin to the perfusion medium. Both interstitial fluid and coronary effluent showed dehydrogenase and oxidase activity after no flow ischaemia. Furthermore, the ratio of lactate dehydrogenase to creatine kinase in coronary effluents was reduced. These findings indicate that the myocardial interstitium may be a site of ischaemic membrane damage since this space contains hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase. The protective effect of superoxide dismustase also indicates the possibility of damage due to oxygen derived radicals in the cardiac interstitium during low flow perfusion."
"Denervation supersensitivity in chronically denervated kidneys increases renal responsiveness to increased plasma levels of norepinephrine. To determine whether this effect is caused by presynaptic (i.e., loss of uptake) or postsynaptic changes, we studied the effect of continuous infusion of norepinephrine (330 ng/min, i.v.) and methoxamine (4 micrograms/min, i.v.), an alpha 1-adrenergic agonist that is not taken up by nerve terminals, on renal function of innervated and denervated kidneys. Ganglionic blockade was used to eliminate reflex adjustments in the innervated kidney and mean arterial pressure was maintained at preganglionic blockade levels by an infusion of arginine vasopressin. With renal perfusion pressure controlled there was a significantly greater decrease in renal blood flow (-67 +/- 9 vs. -33 +/- 8\%), glomerular filtration rate (-60 +/- 9 vs. -7 +/- 20\%), urine flow (-61 +/- 7 vs. -24 +/- 11\%), sodium excretion (-51 +/- 15 vs. -32 +/- 21\%), and fractional excretion of sodium (-50 +/- 9 vs. -25 +/- 15\%) from the denervated kidneys compared with the innervated kidneys during the infusion of norepinephrine. During the infusion of methoxamine there was a significantly greater decrease from the denervated compared with the innervated kidneys in renal blood flow (-54 +/- 10 vs. -30 +/- 14\%), glomerular filtration rate (-51 +/- 11 vs. -19 +/- 17\%), urine flow (-55 +/- 10 vs. -39 +/- 10\%), sodium excretion (-70 +/- 9 vs. -59 +/- 11\%), and fractional excretion of sodium (-53 +/- 10 vs. -41 +/- 10\%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"It was found that phenylephrine and methoxamine had two effects (one was inhibitory and the other was augmentative) on isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP in rat parotid slices. The augmentation was abolished by alpha-adrenergic antagonists or by omission of calcium in the medium. Cyclic AMP accumulation by norepinephrine (NE) was significantly decreased by omission of calcium in the medium. Calmodulin antagonists, trifluoperazine and W-7, decreased NE-induced cyclic AMP accumulation, but another calmodulin antagonist, carmidazolium, did not. Phorbol ester such as 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate and phorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate, did not augment the effect of isoproterenol. These results suggest that although the influx of calcium is required in the alpha-adrenergic agonists-induced augmentation, calmodulin and protein kinase C may not be intermediates in this process. Calcium ions (10(-7) and 10(-6) M) slightly increased the activity of adenylate cyclase, but calcium (10(-6)-10(-4) M) dose-dependently inhibited the effect of isoproterenol. Therefore, calcium ions do not participate in the augmentation by directly modulating the activity of adenylate cyclase. The inhibitory effect was not affected by alpha-adrenergic antagonists. The activation of adenylate cyclase by isoproterenol was inhibited by phenylephrine with higher inhibition being obtained in lower concentrations of isoproterenol. Phenylephrine in the presence of isobutylmethylxanthine increased the amount of cyclic AMP and this effect was inhibited by propranolol, but not by phentolamine. [3H]-CGP 12177 binding of the parotid membrane was inhibited by alpha-adrenergic antagonists. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of phenylephrine and methoxamine may be mediated by beta-adrenergic receptor."
"We studied the effects of adrenergic agonists on the capacity of blood trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi to associate with (i.e., bind and/or penetrate) host cells in vitro. The extent of T. cruzi association with mouse macrophages in the presence of the beta-adrenergic agonist L-isoproterenol was significantly decreased with respect to mock-treated controls. Similar results were obtained when the parasite was pretreated with L-isoproterenol and was then allowed to interact with untreated macrophages. In contrast, pretreatment of trypomastigotes with either L-phenylephrine or methoxamine-alpha-adrenergic agonists--enhanced their reactivity with macrophages. Interaction with a nonphagocytic host cell was also decreased and increased by parasite pretreatment with beta- and alpha-adrenergic agonists, respectively. The L-isoproterenol and L-phenylephrine effects were no longer detectable 2 and 3 hr after their removal, respectively, and were therefore reversible. Atenolol, a specific beta 1 adrenoreceptor blocker inhibited the L-isoproterenol effect, whereas butoxamine, a specific beta 2 blocker, did not. Thus, beta 1-like but not beta 2-like binding sites appeared to be expressed on T. cruzi. Both prazosin and yohimbine, preferential alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptor blockers, respectively, abolished the L-phenylephrine effect. The opposite effects of alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists suggested that the infectivity of T. cruzi may be regulated by activation of surface components comparable to the adreno-receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"The alpha adrenoceptor subtypes mediating vasoconstriction to exogenous agonists and to spinal sympathetic nerve stimulation have been characterized in the autoperfused (constant flow) femoral (predominantly skeletal musculature) and saphenous (predominantly cutaneous) vascular beds of the pithed rat. Intra-arterial infusion of the alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist, methoxamine, increased perfusion pressure in both vascular beds over the same range of infusion rates, and the maximum responses were similar. The selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, B-HT 933, also increased perfusion pressure in both beds, although the maximum response to B-HT 933 in the saphenous bed was approximately twice that observed in the femoral bed. Responses to methoxamine were blocked by the alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (0.1 mg/kg), but not the alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, rauwolscine (1 mg/kg), or by the selective postjunctional alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, SK&F 104078 (1 mg/kg). Conversely, responses to B-HT 933 were blocked by rauwolscine and by SK&F 104078, but not by prazosin. Vasopressor responses to B-HT 933 in both vascular beds of the rat hindlimb also were reduced markedly by the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine (1 mg/kg), whereas responses to methoxamine were relatively resistant to inhibition by nifedipine. In the femoral bed, as in the systemic arterial circulation, responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation were strongly inhibited by prazosin, were potentiated by rauwolscine and were unaffected by SK&F 104078. In contrast, in the saphenous arterial bed, the responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation were inhibited by all three antagonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Effects of methoxamine and phenylephrine on the action potential and the membrane currents in spontaneously beating rabbit sino-atrial node cells were examined by means of a two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. Both methoxamine and phenylephrine (10(-4) mol/l) prolonged the cycle length (CL) and the action potential duration (APD), significantly. At concentrations higher than 3 x 10(-4) mol/l, phenylephrine increased the maximum rate of rise of action potential (Vmax) but methoxamine reduced it. Both agents depolarized the maximum diastolic potential (MDP). These changes in the action potential parameters occurred in a concentration-dependent manner. In the presence of phentolamine (10(-5) mol/l), methoxamine (3 x 10(-4) mol/l) did not modify the action potential parameters. Also, phenylephrine did not affect them during exposure to phentolamine (10(-5) mol/l) and pindolol (10(-7) mol/l). In voltage-clamp experiments, at 10(-3) mol/l both methoxamine and phenylephrine slightly increased the slow inward current (Isi), but decreased the time-dependent outward current (Ik). The steady-state activation variable of Ik (p infinity) was unaffected by these agents. The hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih) was suppressed in the presence of methoxamine, but enhanced in the presence of phenylephrine. An additional application of pindolol (10(-7) mol/l) during exposure to phenylephrine (10(-3) mol/l) depressed the action potential amplitude (APA) and Vmax, and prolonged CL slightly. Under the same condition, all the membrane currents (Isi, Ik and Ih) were decreased. In addition, the time courses of decay for Isi were not modified in the absence and the presence of phenylephrine (10(-3) mol/l) and phenylephrine plus pindolol (10(-7) mol/l).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"We studied the timing of the electrophysiological effects of sympathetic supersensitivity with chronically implanted electrodes in the anterior and posterior left ventricular free wall in 10 dogs. We produced denervation of the anterior wall in six dogs by application of phenol surrounding the anterior electrode. Drug infusions that were performed under pentobarbital sodium anesthesia included norepinephrine, isoproterenol, and methoxamine. In four controls there was no difference in response of the two sites. Presynaptic supersensitivity was manifest as early as 2 days and as late as 64 days by a parallel left shift (greater than or equal to 8.3 ms) in the norepinephrine dose to effective refractory period shortening response curve in the anterior compared with posterior left ventricle, P less than 0.01. The isoproterenol dose-response curve was also shifted to the left by 5.6 ms (P less than 0.01) but was manifest only after 10 days and only until 28 days from the denervation procedure. Local repolarization in the denervated areas shortened more than the innervated areas with both drugs. The methoxamine dose-response curve was flat, and the anterior-denervated area was not different than the posterior-innervated area. We conclude that recovery properties in ventricular muscle demonstrate evidence of supersensitivity, which is neurotransmitter and beta- but not alpha-receptor specific."
"The hypothesis that norepinephrine (NE) plays a facilitatory role in controlling the pulsatile release of LHRH was tested with a modified push-pull perfusion technique in conscious rhesus monkeys. The in vivo LHRH release in perfusate samples collected from the stalk-median eminence of ovariectomized females was pulsatile and synchronous with pulsatile LH release. Catecholamines measured in aliquots of perfusate samples revealed that in vivo NE release was also pulsatile and was synchronous with LHRH release. Local infusion of NE or methoxamine (an alpha 1-adrenergic stimulant) through a push cannula stimulated LHRH release, while iv injection of prazosin (an alpha 1-adrenergic blocker) suppressed LHRH release. It is concluded that NE is a possible neurotransmitter stimulating pulsatile LHRH release."
"The potential role that dopaminergic mechanisms have in the regulation of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in the hypothalamus was investigated. Adult male rats were administered bromocriptine, a potent dopamine agonist, for periods ranging up to 51 days. Overall, bromocriptine treatment resulted in a significant decline in CRF-like immunoreactivity (CRF-ir). The dopamine antagonist, haloperidol, was administered for similar periods and resulted in no overall significant effect, except for a transient decrease. Treatment with reserpine, known to deplete monoamines including dopamine, induced a significant decrease in CRF-ir 24 h post-treatment. The possibility that the original results were due to alpha-adrenergic inhibition by bromocriptine and haloperidol was studied next. alpha 1-Stimulation by administration of methoxamine had no significant effect. alpha 2-Stimulation by clonidine significantly reduced hypothalamic CRF-ir. Selective depletion of neurotransmitter from noradrenergic and adrenergic neurons by 6-hydroxydopamine also resulted in a significant reduction of hypothalamic CRF-ir, an effect localized entirely to the median eminence. These results show a reduction in CRF-ir subsequent to either bromocriptine administration, generalized monoamine depletion, alpha 2-stimulation, or selective noradrenaline-adrenaline depletion. No direct dopaminergic effects could be confirmed. These data are consistent with a constant, near-maximal alpha 1-adrenergic effect maintaining hypothalamic CRF concentrations, presumably by inhibition of CRF release from the median eminence."
"The effects of several alpha-adrenoreceptor agonists and antagonists administered intrathecally at T10 level on renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) were examined, in chloralose-urethane anaesthetised rats. Intrathecal noradrenaline (NA, 0.5-500 micrograms) produced one of 3 responses depending on dose, an inhibition of RSNA at low doses, an excitation of RSNA at high doses, or a biphasic effect. Intrathecal adrenaline (5-200 micrograms) was inhibitory in the main but some doses elicited poorly repeatable brief excitation followed by prolonged inhibition. Intrathecal methoxamine (ME; 2.5 ng-25 micrograms) caused a dose-dependent increase in RSNA (mean maximum response 27 +/- 0.5\%). The excitatory effects of NA and ME were blocked (72\% +/- 12\%) by pretreatment with intrathecal prazosin (PRA, 20-200 ng) but not by yohimbine (YOH, 200 ng). Intrathecal guanabenz (GUA 3-15 micrograms) caused a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on RSNA (mean maximum 32\% +/- 5\%). The inhibitory effects of NA, adrenaline and GUA were blocked by pretreatment with intrathecal YOH (200 ng-2 micrograms). Intrathecal PRA (200 ng) had no effect on the inhibitory effects of NA and GUA. Intravenous administration of each of the adrenoreceptor agonists (apart from adrenaline), at similar doses to those given intrathecally, in most cases had no significant effect on RSNA; in a few cases the opposite effects to those produced by intrathecal administration were seen."
"The effects of alpha 1-adrenergic agonists on the waveforms of action potentials and voltage-gated ionic currents were examined in isolated adult rat ventricular myocytes by the whole-cell patch-clamp recording technique. After "puffer" applications of either of two alpha 1 agonists, phenylephrine and methoxamine, action-potential durations were increased. In voltage-clamped cells, phenylephrine (5-20 microM) or methoxamine (5-10 microM) reduced the amplitudes of Ca2+-independent voltage-activated outward K+ currents (Iout); neither the kinetics nor the voltage-dependent properties of Iout were significantly affected. The effects of phenylephrine or methoxamine on Iout were larger and longer-lasting at higher concentrations and after prolonged or repeated exposures; in all experiments, however, Iout recovered completely when puffer applications were discontinued. The suppression of Iout is attributed to the activation of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, as neither beta- nor alpha 2-adrenergic agonists had measurable effects on Iout; in addition, the effect of phenylephrine was attenuated in the presence of the alpha antagonist phentolamine (10 microM), but not in the presence of the beta antagonist propranolol (10 microM). Voltage-gated Ca2+ currents, in contrast, were not altered measurably by phenylephrine or methoxamine and no currents were activated directly by these agents. Suppression of Iout was also observed during puffer applications of either of two protein kinase C activators, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 nM-1 microM) and 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (60 microM). We conclude that the activation of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors in adult rat ventricular myocytes leads to action-potential prolongation as a result of the specific suppression of Iout and that this effect may be mediated by activation of protein kinase C."
"Mesenteric arteries from streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats developed greater contractile force in response to norepinephrine and related alpha-agonists than arteries from age-matched controls. Subsequent experiments attempted to define the mechanisms underlying these findings. Transmural nerve stimulation of mesenteric arteries from both groups of animals revealed a similar optimal frequency and voltage of stimulation; however, arteries from STZ-diabetic rats developed greater contractile force than controls. Second, determination of selective alpha-adrenergic antagonist affinities (pA2 values) revealed qualitatively similar postjunctional alpha 1-adrenoceptors in both groups of arteries. Third, disruption of the endothelium did not abolish the enhanced responsiveness of arteries from STZ-diabetic rats. In contrast, the increased vascular responsiveness in STZ-diabetes was associated with a greater dependency on extracellular calcium, with no change in the response to alpha-agonist-induced release of calcium from cellular stores. Thus the enhanced responsiveness of mesenteric arteries from STZ-diabetic rats to alpha-adrenergic agonists cannot be attributed to neuronal deterioration, altered postjunctional alpha-adrenoceptor subtypes, endothelium degeneration, or enhanced release of intracellular calcium but is associated with a greater dependency on extracellular calcium."
"Acute intraperitoneal injection of clozapine produced marked hypothermia and ataxia in Swiss-Webster mice. These two effects were almost completely blocked by the lipophilic alpha 1-adrenergic agonist, St 587, but not by the peripherally-acting alpha 1 agonist methoxamine. It was inferred that these effects of clozapine are central in origin and probably resulted from alpha 1 adrenergic blockade. However, since prazosin, a selective alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist did not elicit either hypothermia or ataxia in mice it became clear that the alpha 1 adrenergic blocking effect of clozapine is not entirely responsible for these effects, but has a major contributory role in their production. Both clozapine and prazosin inhibited the d-amphetamine-induced locomotor stimulation in mice. St 587 did not significantly reduce this amphetamine-blocking effect of clozapine. It was inferred that this response to d-amphetamine involving the release of mesolimbic dopamine is distinct from the other two St 587-sensitive responses. The hypothermic and ataxic effects of clozapine developed complete tolerance after just four days of treatment, but ten days of such treatment was required for the development of tolerance to the amphetamine-blocking effect of clozapine. The possible relationships between St 587-sensitive and insensitive effects of clozapine and its antipsychotic property are discussed."
"1. Exogenous dopamine (DA), octopamine (OA), noradrenaline (NA), and the alpha 1-agonist methoxamine (MX), all induce tonic and rhythmic contractions in the rat vas deferens. 2. Tonic and rhythmic contractions can be separated by use of different concentrations of alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists, verapamil, pyrogallol (a COMT-inhibitor) and lowering bath temperature (greater than 20 degrees C). 3. The two types of contraction could not be distinguished by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, cocaine (uptake 1 blocker) or metanephrine (uptake 2 blocker). 4. It is suggested that the tonic and rhythmic contractions induced by amines are mediated by different alpha-adrenoceptors."
"In the present study we examined the contractile responses of aortae and mesenteric and femoral arteries taken from rats treated 3 weeks previously with streptozotocin (55 mg/kg, i.v.) or saline (1 mL/kg, i.v.) to vasopressin, potassium chloride, and methoxamine. The dose-response curves obtained with vasopressin and methoxamine were not significantly different between control and diabetic animals. However, both the diabetic mesenteric and femoral arteries showed a significantly (p less than 0.05) greater maximum response to potassium chloride as compared with their respective controls. The reactivity of the diabetic aortae to this agonist was not different. It is concluded that while the contractile responses of the diabetic tissues were normal when the agonist was vasopressin or methoxamine, there would appear to be regionally selective changes in responsiveness to potassium chloride."
"1. The effects of the alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonists, prazosin and yohimbine, have been examined on the isometric contraction of the rabbit pulmonary artery produced by alpha 1-adrenoreceptor agonists. Cocaine, corticosterone and propranolol were present throughout and either a single or two concentration-response curve method was used. 2. Prazosin and yohimbine competitively antagonized the responses to agonists but did not reveal differences between agonists. 3. Using the single concentration-response curve method, prazosin had pA2 values of 9.06 against clonidine and 8.76 against methoxamine. 4. Using the two concentration-response curve method the absolute pA2 values of prazosin (8.65 against phenylephrine, 8.78 against clonidine) and yohimbine (5.73 against phenylephrine, 5.72 against clonidine), as well as the relative potencies of the two antagonists (prazosin approximately 1000 times more potent than yohimbine), suggest that both agonists act on alpha 1-adrenoreceptors. 5. There is no evidence from this study to support the suggestion that the rabbit pulmonary artery contains two subtypes of alpha 1-adrenoreceptor."
"Postoperative right ventricular (RV) myocardial function was evaluated in 6 patients who underwent atrial switching for simple transposition of the great arteries (TGA). The average age at study was 5.5 years. RV function was evaluated at rest and during administration of methoxamine by cardiac catheterization and RV angiography. The data were compared with left ventricular function in a control group, which consisted of 6 patients, 3 with functional murmur and 3 with pulmonary valvar stenosis. During stress, the TGA group showed a significant increase in end-diastolic pressure, minute work index and end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indexes, along with a significant decrease in ejection fraction. The control group also showed an increase in these variables except for ejection fraction during stress, which did not change. The slope of the work-function curve for the TGA group was lower than that for the control group (p = 0.02). The TGA group had a lower slope of the peak systolic pressure-volume relation than the control group (p = 0.005). There was no significant correlation between the slope of the peak systolic pressure-volume relation and age at repair or study. This study shows that RV pump dysfunction observed in postoperative TGA patients may be caused by depressed myocardial function."
"Four pregnant and four castrated ewes were chronically instrumented for the measurement of external iliac blood flow to test the hypothesis that pregnancy alters alpha-adrenergic sensitivity in a major regional circulation. Complete dose-response curves were generated to methoxamine, phenylephrine, and norepinephrine. Pregnancy was associated with no change in methoxamine sensitivity, an increase in phenylephrine sensitivity, and a decrease in norepinephrine sensitivity. These differential changes in drug sensitivity suggest (1) the alpha 1-receptor population is functionally similar between the two groups of animals, (2) uptake 1 is inhibited, and (3) either catechol-O-methyltransferase activity is increased or the alpha 2- or beta-receptor population changes in this circulation during pregnancy. These data illustrate the complexity of the change in the adrenergic system during pregnancy."
"Neurogenic influence on cervical secretion was studied in experiments performed on isolated guinea-pig cervix with intact adjacent nerves. The secretion was estimated as carbohydrate efflux. Experiments were undertaken at ovulation time when secretion is most prominent. Hypogastric nerve stimulation significantly increased carbohydrate release. This response was unaffected by phentolamine but inhibited by TTX, scopolamine and hexamethonium, as well as previous destruction of paracervical ganglia. Pelvic nerve stimulation did not affect cervical secretion. Carbachol as well as VIP induced a secretory response of the same extent as did hypogastric nerve stimulation. Scopolamine abolished the VIP-induced secretion. VIP and carbachol in combination had no additive effect. It is concluded that cervical glands of the guinea-pig uterus possess a cholinergic secretomotor innervation. The main pathway is the hypogastric nerve and neurons have a peripheral relay at paracervical ganglia. A more complex peripheral organization cannot be excluded."
"Using recently available selective agonists and antagonists we have examined further our postulate (Apperley et al., 1980) that 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) mediates contraction of dog saphenous vein via a different 5-HT receptor type from that in the rabbit aorta. In the rabbit isolated aorta, ketanserin and spiperone were potent, specific, competitively-acting antagonists of the contractile effects of 5-HT. In contrast, in the dog isolated saphenous vein neither ketanserin nor spiperone caused any rightward displacement of concentration-response curves to 5-HT although the maximum response was reduced by about 10\%. In the rabbit aorta 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CONH2-T) was a weak agonist whilst the 5-N,N-dimethyl and 5-N-ethyl derivatives were even weaker or inactive. The contractile effect of 5-CONH2-T in the rabbit aorta was potently and competitively antagonized by ketanserin. In contrast, in the dog saphenous vein 5-CONH2-T and its 5-N,N-dimethyl and 5-N-ethyl derivatives were all potent agonists. The contractile effect of 5-CONH2-T was not markedly affected by ketanserin. The profile of action of ketanserin and spiperone in the rabbit aorta is consistent with the view that 5-HT2 receptors mediate contraction in this preparation. However, the 5-HT receptor mediating contraction in the dog saphenous vein appears to be '5-HT1-like', sharing a number of characteristics with the 5-HT1 recognition site identified from [3H]-5-HT ligand binding studies in brain tissue."
"We have studied the role of central alpha-1 adrenoceptor mechanisms which stimulate cortisol secretion throughout the 24 h period in man. Six normal subjects were given 24 h i.v. infusions of the alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine, the alpha-1 antagonist thymoxamine, and saline under double-blind conditions. The only cardiovascular effects of these adrenergic manipulations was a slight bradycardia accompanying the methoxamine infusion. The methoxamine infusion was accompanied by higher concentrations of cortisol than the saline infusion during waking hours and the food related secretory surges were exaggerated, while the converse held with thymoxamine. In contrast, the nocturnal surge of cortisol secretion was unaffected by these adrenergic manipulations. These findings suggest that an alpha-1 adrenoceptor mechanism contributes to the maintenance of cortisol secretion during waking hours, but not at night."
"The relative importance of vascular relaxations induced by atriopeptins (AP), the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline and of the neuropeptide VIP was studied in vitro on circular and longitudinal preparations of the rat portal vein. Two members of the rat atriopeptins (AP II and III) were equipotent with respect to relaxation of the spontaneously contracting outer, longitudinal layer and of the alpha 1-contracted inner, circular layer. The potency for AP II was about 13 times lower in the inner (pD2 = 7.48 +/- 0.73, n = 6) than in the outer layer (pD2 = 8.60 +/- 0.34, n = 6). No significant difference was apparent between the intrinsic activities for AP II in the two layers. The potencies for AP II were for both layers higher than those for VIP while the intrinsic activities for AP II were significantly lower than for VIP and for the reference agonist, isoprenaline in both layers. Atriopeptin II was equally efficient in relaxing the K+-depolarized and alpha 1-contracted longitudinal segments. Neither the beta-antagonist, propranolol nor the guanylate cyclase inhibitor, methylene blue, modified the potency or the intrinsic activity of AP II. These results suggest that concentrations of circulating atriopeptins above 10 nM may contribute to reduction of vascular tone by the methylene blue insensitive receptors for AP II and III in the portal-mesenteric vein region."
"The influence of pH on split-dose hyperthermic response of non-resistant and thermotolerant Ehrlich tumors was studied. Vasoactive agents, methoxamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and, mechanical interruption of the tumor blood flow by wire technique were applied in combination with hyperthermia at 72-hour intervals, where an increased thermal response was observed in Ehrlich tumor. A potential influence in suppressing the induction of thermotolerance (hyperthermia at 24-hour intervals) was evident in the case of 5-HT and methoxamine. These vasoactive agents and the wire technique showed a selective effect in reducing the tumor microcirculation as well as lowering its pH. However, unlike the wire technique, the pH was rather low in the postheating period in the case of 5-HT and methoxamine. Poor tumor vascularization induced by vasoactive agents or physical means would demonstrate a poor nutritional condition with a low pH, whereby an increase in thermal response would be obvious and may be expected to have maximal influence either in the decay or in delaying the induction of thermotolerance. A low tumor pH particularly during the postheating period may have some role against the development of thermotolerance."
"Effects of alpha-human natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) on isolated canine vascular strips were examined in 6 arteries and 5 veins. Under the preconstriction with either methoxamine, prostaglandin F2 alpha or KCl, ANP relaxed the vascular strips to various degrees, depending on the region removed from the circulatory system. The largest relaxation was obtained in the pulmonary artery, suggesting that the pulmonary artery may be an important site of action of ANP."
"In order to test the importance of the association of diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension in generating morphological and functional changes of the left ventricle (LV) consistent with a cardiomyopathy, 37 patients, aged 27 +/- 6.7 years, were studied by standard and digitized M-Mode echo: eighteen of them were affected by diabetes mellitus, 11 by arterial hypertension, 8 by diabetes and hypertension. Each group was compared to the others and with a group of 14 normal subjects. In order to verify the importance of increased ventricular after-load in modifying ventricular performance of diabetic patients, changes of the peak rate of systolic and diastolic variation of LV diameter and changes of the peak rate of interventricular septum and posterior wall excursion (IVSE, PWE) were evaluated after methoxamine hydrochloride infusion in 8 diabetic and 6 normal subjects. In diabetics the ratio between ventricular thickness and diameter (h/r) was greater than normal subjects (p less than 0.02); this ratio resulted higher in patients with diabetic rhinopathy who also exhibited an isovolumic diastolic period longer than normal (p less than 0.02). Both h/r ratio and isovolumic diastolic period (IDP) were higher in diabetic-hypertensive group as compared to normals (p less than 0.001), strictly diabetic (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.001) or hypertensive subjects (p less than 0.01). Diabetic-hypertensive group, exhibited a lowering of the systolic and diastolic peak rate of IVSE (p less than 0.01) as well as of systolic peak rate of PWE as compared to the other three groups (p less than 0.05)."
"The present study shows that positive and negative modulation of the immunoglobulin M antibody response in mouse spleen cells immunized with sheep erythrocytes can be achieved by selective activation of alpha adrenoceptor subtypes. Alpha-1 adrenoceptor activation by methoxamine produced a number of spleen cells secreting immunoglobulin M antibody which was enhanced 63\% above control on day 4 after immunization and which returned to control levels on days 5 (peak day of control antibody response), 6 and 7. This response mimicked the previously reported response produced by norepinephrine in the presence of propranolol, but not by norepinephrine alone. Alpha-2 adrenoceptor activation by clonidine produced no change when compared to control on days 4, 6 or 7, but produced a 50\% suppression on day 5. Activation of both adrenoceptor subtypes by phenylephrine produced a control response on day 4, a depressed response on day 5 and an elevated response on days 6 and 7 by 50 and 64\% above control, respectively. All drug responses were concentration-dependent and the methoxamine and clonidine responses were antagonized by phentolamine. These results suggest that antibody responses can be modulated by alpha-1 adrenoceptor activation to produce an enhanced response 1 day sooner than the peak control response and by alpha-2 adrenoceptor activation to produce a depressed response at the time of the peak control response."
"Ergonovine, methoxamine and clonidine were administered intravenously in order to clarify the mechanism of coronary artery spasm in canine experiments. After these administrations, 27.5\% of the dogs treated with ergonovine, 59.5\% of the dogs treated with methoxamine and 72.7\% of the dogs treated with clonidine showed ST segment elevation. The combined application of propranolol with ergonovine or methoxamine could more easily induce ST segment elevation than a single application of ergonovine or methoxamine. Most cases of elevated ST segment returned to the normal after the administration of nitroglycerin and phentolamine. Yohimbine was completely effective for the restoration of normal ST segment. Plasma norepinephrine decreased to 20 +/- 8.0\% of the control when ST segment elevation was induced. This is a significantly greater decrease than that seen without ST segment elevation (p less than 0.001). Concomitant with the restoration of normal ST segment, plasma norepinephrine increased after the administration of yohimbine. Methoxamine and clonidine increased (p less than 0.01) and yohimbine decreased (p less than 0.01) coronary vascular resistance. Coronary spasm was visualized on coronary arteriogram after the application of clonidine; also coronary vasodilation was visualized after the administration of yohimbine. These results confirm the hypothesis that coronary artery spasm is mediated by pre- and postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors."
"To investigate the in vivo interaction between calcium entry blockade by nitrendipine (a dihydropyridine calcium entry blocker) and alpha adrenergic-mediated end-organ responsiveness, four series of experiments were carried out in normal Sprague-Dawley rats. In ganglion-blocked rats (hexamethonium, 10 mg/kg i.p. plus atropine, 1.0 mg/kg i.p.), nitrendipine (0.3 mg/kg) antagonized the pressor responses to angiotensin II and vasopressin as well as to norepinephrine, thus indicating the lack of specificity of its antagonism to alpha adrenergic vasoconstriction. The results of the next two series of experiments showed first that, in pithed rats, nitrendipine (0.01 to 0.3 mg/kg) in presence of prazosin shifted the norepinephrine pressor dose-response curves to the right whereas it was ineffective in yohimbine-pretreated animals. These data, suggesting a preferential alpha-2 antagonism by nitrendipine, were confirmed further by its little effect on pressor responses to methoxamine as contrasted with its marked progressive depression of the maximum response to B-HT 920 (about 80\% at the highest rate of infusion). However, qualitatively similar results were obtained by the noncalcium entry blocker vasodilators, both sodium nitroprusside and hydralazine, both of which led to minor shifts to the right of the methoxamine pressor dose-response curves, whereas dose-dependently depressing the maximum pressor response to B-HT 920 (about 70 and 40\%, respectively). Thus, calcium entry blockade appeared to antagonize preferentially alpha-2-mediated vasoconstriction, but this effect was common to other vasodilators devoid of calcium entry blocking properties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"We attempted to determine whether the inhibition of renin release from rat kidney cortical slices by alpha adrenoceptor agonists is mediated by activation of alpha-1 and/or alpha-2 adrenoceptors, and to investigate the role of calcium in the mechanisms of this inhibition. Norepinephrine (NE), methoxamine (ME) and phenylephrine (PE) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of renin release from rat kidney cortical slices, whereas clonidine was without effect. NE-, ME- and PE-induced inhibition of renin release was blocked by prazosin, which was 2 or 3 orders of magnitude more potent than yohimbine. The inhibitory effects of NE, ME and PE on renin release from the slices were abolished by removal of calcium from the incubation medium. Calcium antagonists, verapamil and nifedipine, attenuated the responses of renin release to NE, ME and PE, in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibitory effects of NE, ME and PE on renin release were blocked significantly by N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide, a calmodulin antagonist, but not by N-(6-aminohexyl)-1-naphthalenesulfonamide, which has virtually no calmodulin antagonistic activity. These findings suggest that alpha adrenoceptor agonists inhibit renin release from rat kidney cortical slices mainly via alpha-1 adrenoceptors and that calcium influx followed by the activation of the calcium-calmodulin system is involved in the above inhibition."
"Canine saphenous vein (CSV) has been shown to contain both postsynaptic alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors. Our previous studies have shown that activation of postsynaptic alpha-1 adrenoceptors in this tissue utilizes both extracellular and intracellular Ca++ to produce contractions. In the present study, the source of calcium mobilized by activation of postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors in CSV was elucidated. Contractions of tissue rings to the supramaximal concentrations of three selective alpha-2 agonists, B-HT 920, M-7 and clonidine, were determined in the absence and presence of 5 mM La . In the presence of La , clonidine and M-7 produced small but statistically significant contractions (8-14\% of control) which were abolished when the alpha-1 adrenoceptors were inactivated by phenoxybenzamine (10(-7) M, 30 min). In contrast, contractions to B-HT 920 were abolished completely in the presence of La . All the three alpha-2 agonists stimulated 45Ca++ uptake into CSV (0.3-0.4 mmol/kg wet weight, 10 min). 45Ca++ efflux studies demonstrated that the selective alpha-2 agonist, B-HT 920 (10(-5) M plus 10(-7) M phenoxybenzamine), did not induce an increase in the rate of 45Ca++ efflux. In contrast, an augmented 45Ca++ efflux rate was observed with the alpha-1 agonist, phenylephrine (10(-4) M plus 10(-7) M rauwolscine). These results suggest that activation of postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors in CSV utilizes primarily extracellular Ca++ to produce contractions."
"Atrial natriuretic peptide (5-28AA; ANP) and atrial extract (ANS) stimulated rat renal gluconeogenesis in cortical tubule suspension in a dose dependent fashion only from substrates that enter gluconeogenesis via phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxylase. The effects of ANP and ANS were significantly potentiated by cAMP and cGMP, whereas methoxamine showed no effect. Extracellular calcium revealed a key role for ANP and ANS response to gluconeogenesis: a concentration of calcium higher than 1 mM was essential. Isolated cells from cortex which lost cell membrane polarity by warming but responded solely to cAMP and cGMP showed no effect by ANP nor ANS. These data suggest that ANP or ANS may act mainly from the basolateral site in the proximal tubule cell and promote gluconeogenesis through cAMP and/or cGMP system."
"Doses of dobutamine (steady-state infusions) required to increase inotropy (as measured by isovolumic indices of contractility) were lower than those required to produce tachycardia in the anaesthetized cat. When compared to isoprenaline, dobutamine produced less tachycardia for common increases in inotropy and thus demonstrated inotropic selectivity in this model. Dobutamine also produced mild pressor effects which were potentiated by beta-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol. In efforts to define the role of the partial agonist activity of dobutamine for alpha-adrenoceptors in the production of selective inotropy the effects of dobutamine infusions were observed in cats pretreated with the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine. In phentolamine-treated cats dobutamine did not demonstrate inotropic selectivity and showed a relationship between increased inotropy and tachycardia which was not significantly different from that obtained with isoprenaline. In contrast, phentolamine did not change the relationship between isoprenaline-induced tachycardia and increased inotropy. These data suggest that the agonist activity of dobutamine for alpha-adrenoceptors could be responsible for selective inotropy in the anaesthetized cat probably by baroreceptor-mediated reflex modulation of heart rate and/or possible stimulation of inotropic cardiac alpha-adrenoceptors."
"The interaction of bromocriptine with several catecholamine receptors that control the sympathetic responses at cardiac and vascular level has been studied in pithed adrenalectomized and vagotomized normotensive rats. Bromocriptine (30 and 100 micrograms/kg) inhibited the stimulation-induced pressor responses in the pithed rat without modifying the pressor responses induced by noradrenaline. Sulpiride (0.3 mg/kg) abolished the effects of bromocriptine (30 micrograms/kg) but only partially prevented the effects of bromocriptine (100 micrograms/kg) on the stimulation-induced pressor responses. Yohimbine (0.3 mg/kg) partially antagonised the inhibitory effect of bromocriptine on stimulation-induced pressor responses. Combination of yohimbine and sulpiride abolished attenuation of the stimulation-induced pressor responses by bromocriptine (100 micrograms/kg). Bromocriptine (0.3 and 1 mg/kg) shifted to the right the frequency-response curve of increases in heart rate. This effect was prevented by yohimbine (0.3 mg/kg) but not by sulpiride (0.3 mg/kg). The same doses of bromocriptine were ineffective on heart rate increases induced by noradrenaline. Bromocriptine (0.3 and 1 mg/kg) shifted to the right the increases in diastolic blood pressure induced by methoxamine without modifying those induced by xylazine and noradrenaline. These results suggest that bromocriptine acts on the peripheral sympathetic nervous system of the pithed rat as an agonist of presynaptic dopamine receptors and alpha 2-adrenoreceptors and as an antagonist of postsynaptic alpha 1-adrenoreceptors."
"We compared the effects of pretreatment with saline, ipratropium bromide, and disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) on bronchoconstriction induced by methoxamine--an alpha-adrenoceptor agonist, in asthmatic subjects. All 12 patients bronchoconstricted in response to methoxamine after saline. The PD20 (the dose of methoxamine causing a 20\% fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1]) ranged from 0.3-18 mumol. Ipratropium bromide (200 micrograms administered by aerosol) significantly inhibited (P less than 0.05) the response to methoxamine in all patients without producing significant changes in the mean baseline lung function. The mean PD20 for methoxamine after saline was 6.8 mumol and 95\% confidence limits (CL) were 3.6, 12.7 mumol. The mean PD20 for methoxamine after ipratropium bromide was 35.4 (95\% CL 28.8, 43.6) mumol. DSCG also produced significant (P less than 0.05) shifts to the right in the methoxamine dose response curves, but did not affect resting airway calibre as measured by the FEV1. The mean PD20 for methoxamine increased from 3.3 mumol (95\% CL 1.1, 10.0 mumol) after saline to 25.1 mumol (95\% CL 14.1, 44.6) after DSCG pretreatment. These findings suggest that alpha-adrenoceptors in the airways of asthmatic subjects may be located at sites other than smooth muscle--possibly on mast cells but more likely on nerve endings and/or parasympathetic ganglia."
"Postjunctional supersensitivity of the smooth muscle of the guinea-pig vas deferens induced by denervation, decentralization and treatment of animals with reserpine has been attributed, in part, to a partial membrane depolarization (8-10 mV) resulting from reduced electrogenic Na+,K+-pumping activity. This study was undertaken to characterize sensitivity changes which occur after treatment of animals with 6-hydroxydopamine (100 mg/kg + 250 mg/kg i.v., 1 day apart). Seven days after the second injection, concentration-response curves for isometric contractile responses to norepinephrine, methoxamine, acetylcholine and histamine were shifted 40.6-, 1.7-, 3.6- and 2.7-fold, respectively, to the left of control; however, the sensitivity to KCl was not increased, which contrasts with the results after denervation, decentralization and reserpine treatment. Ouabain (10(-5) M) produced 1.8- and 1.3-fold leftward shifts of the KCl concentration-response curves in tissues from control and 6-hydroxydopamine-treated animals, respectively. The pronounced effect of ouabain in tissues from treated animals may be an indication that 6-hydroxydopamine treatment does not result in as much inhibition of electrogenic Na+,K+-pumping, and resultant membrane depolarization, as other methods which induce supersensitivity of the guinea-pig vas deferens."
"The present review summarizes recent data on fat cell adrenoceptors with the aim of clarifying the role played by catecholamines in the regulation of adipocyte metabolism. Part of the review is focused on the possible interest of animal models for the study of catecholamine-mediated effects in human fat cells. It is now clearly demonstrated that human, hamster, dog and rabbit fat cells possess three basic types of adrenoceptor: the beta 1-, alpha 2- and alpha 1-adrenoceptors identified in biological assays or binding studies with selected radioligands. The rat is an exception in the species commonly studied as catecholamines exert an exclusive lipolytic effect through beta-adrenoceptor stimulation, there are no alpha 2-adrenoceptors in rat white fat cells although an alpha 1-adrenoceptor does exist. In human fat cells, physiological amines are lipolytic or antilipolytic. Binding studies have revealed that alpha 2-adrenoceptors are three to four times more numerous than beta 1-adrenoceptors. Moreover physiological amines, in particular epinephrine, have a higher affinity for alpha 2-sites than for beta 1-sites. Dose-response studies of the effect of epinephrine on adenosine-deaminase or isoproterenol-stimulated fat-cells demonstrate an inhibitory effect of epinephrine on lipolysis promoted by stimulation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors which occurs before the commonly described beta 1-adrenergic effect which promotes stimulation of lipolysis. This aspect and its putative physiological interest is described and discussed. Intraspecific variations in adrenergic responses of adipocytes have been briefly analysed. The appearance and disappearance of alpha 2-adrenoceptors according to the extent of adipose tissue and increment of fat cell size are discussed. Variations of adrenergic responsiveness during fasting, calorie restriction or chronic stimulation of the adipocytes by physiological amines are also discussed."
"Rat adipocytes were incubated with [32P]phosphate to label glycogen synthase, which was rapidly immunoprecipitated from cellular extracts and cleaved using either CNBr or trypsin. All of the [32P]phosphate in synthase was recovered in two CNBr fragments, denoted CB-1 and CB-2. Isoproterenol (1 microM) rapidly decreased the synthase activity ratio (-glucose-6-P/+glucose-6-P) and stimulated the phosphorylation of both CB-1 and CB-2 by approximately 30\%. Insulin opposed the decrease in activity ratio and blocked the stimulation of phosphorylation by isoproterenol. Incubating cells with insulin alone changed the 32P content of neither CB-1 nor CB-2. Trypsin fragments were separated by reverse phase liquid chromatography and divided into peak fractions, denoted F-I-F-VII in order of increasing hydrophobicity. F-V contained almost half of the [32P]phosphate and was phosphorylated when synthase was immunoprecipitated from unlabeled fat cells and incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP and the cAMP-independent protein kinase, FA/GSK-3. That F-V also had the same retention time as the skeletal muscle synthase fragment containing sites 3(a + b + c) suggests that it contains sites 3. Muscle sites 1a, 5, 1b, and 2 eluted with F-I, F-II, F-VI, and F-VII, respectively. F-V was increased approximately 25\% by isoproterenol, but the largest relative increases were observed in F-I (4-fold), F-III (4-fold), and F-VI (2-fold). These results indicate that beta-adrenergic receptor activation results in increased phosphorylation of multiple sites on glycogen synthase. Insulin plus glucose decreased the overall 32P content of synthase by approximately 30\%, with the largest decrease (40\%) occurring in F-V. Without glucose, insulin decreased the [32P]phosphate in F-V by 17\%, an effect which was balanced by increases in F-I, F-II, and F-III so that no net change in the total 32P contents of the fractions was observed. Thus, activation of glycogen synthase by the glucose transport-independent pathway seems to involve a redistribution of phosphate in the synthase subunit."
"The rat is a species in which the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is highly immature at birth. Blood pressure was measured directly in anesthetized preparations starting on the first postnatal day (days 1, 5, 9, 20, 40, 55, and 85), and pharmacological tests were used to evaluate the functional development of the vasomotor nerves (maximum pressor response to tyramine), the sensitivity of the vasculature to direct stimulation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors (maximum and 50\% effective dose of methoxamine pressor response), and relative magnitude of the SNS contribution to resting blood pressure (hypotensive response to ganglionic blockade divided by resting blood pressure). The SNS contribution was not significant on postnatal day 1, but the relative magnitude was comparable to the adult by the end of the first postnatal week. During week 1 the vasomotor nerves were functionally immature (tyramine response was 48\% of mature value on day 5), and the vasculature was supersensitive to alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation (154\% of mature value). Conversely, in postnatal weeks 2 and 3, when the developing SNS is known to be hyperactive, the vasculature was subsensitive to noradrenergic stimulation (60-70\% of adult). The net effect was to attenuate the SNS contribution to resting blood pressure during this period (55\% of adult value). We conclude that there is an inverse relation between the level of tonic SNS activity and vascular sensitivity to noradrenergic stimulation in the developing rat. Supersensitivity may be critical for cardiovascular adjustments to asphyxia perinatally when the vasomotor nerves are functionally immature; subsensitivity may act homeostatically to prevent hypertension during the developmental period when SNS is hyperactive."
"The effects of atriopeptins I and II on relaxation and cyclic GMP levels were studied on rat and rabbit aortas. Atriopeptin I was 2- and 100-fold less potent than atriopeptin II in causing relaxation of rat and rabbit aortas, respectively. The atriopeptin-elevated cyclic GMP levels generally correlated with the amount of relaxation. These results demonstrate that the vasodilator profile and, presumably, the receptor for atrial natriuretic factor, varies among different blood vessels and species."
"This study examines the effects of calcium-entry blockade by nifedipine on alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated contractile responses of the human isolated digital artery to exogenous agonists and sympathetic nerve stimulation. Spiral strips of digital artery were mounted for isometric tension recording in physiological salt solution. Contractile responses to TL-99 and to norepinephrine in the presence of prazosin were effectively antagonized by rauwolscine and are therefore presumably mediated by alpha-2 adrenoceptors. Responses to norepinephrine in the presence of rauwolscine were antagonized by prazosin and are therefore mediated predominantly by alpha-1 adrenoceptors. Responses to methoxamine were antagonized by prazosin and, to a lesser extent, by rauwolscine, suggesting that this agonist is also activating alpha-2 adrenoceptors. Nifedipine antagonism of contractile responses was assessed as the percentage of inhibition of the area under the agonist concentration-effect curve or nerve stimulation frequency-effect curve. Nifedipine (10(-9) to 10(-7) M) inhibited responses to TL-99 and methoxamine to similar extents. Nifedipine (10(-8) and 10(-7) M) also had similar effects on the alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated responses (in the presence of rauwolscine and prazosin, respectively) to either exogenous norepinephrine or sympathetic nerve stimulation. At concentrations up to 10(-6) M, nifedipine failed to reduce the efflux of [3H]norepinephrine produced by sympathetic nerve stimulation at either 2 or 8 Hz. We conclude that the alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated contractile responses of the human digital artery are dependent to similar extents on calcium entry through the slow calcium channels of the cell membrane."
"Possible involvement of central alpha-2 adrenoceptors in the hypertensive response to i.c.v. injected clonidine was investigated in free-moving, normotensive rats. Clonidine (2-50 micrograms) injected i.c.v. produced a dose-dependent and long-lasting pressor response associated with bradycardia in conscious rats, but a long-lasting depressor response in anesthetized rats. The pressor response to clonidine (20 micrograms i.c.v.) was antagonized in a dose-dependent manner by central (i.c.v.) pretreatment with yohimbine (20-100 micrograms) and was abolished by a high dose (100 micrograms), whereas the same dose of yohimbine injected i.v. had less effect on the response. Central pretreatment with prazosin (10 and 20 micrograms) inhibited, but did not abolish, the pressor response to clonidine. However, systemic (i.v.) pretreatment with the same dose of prazosin (10 and 20 mu) was more effective in reducing the clonidine-induced pressor response than central pretreatment with the drug. The pressor response to clonidine (20 micrograms i.c.v.) was not significantly modified by central pretreatment with pyrilamine (50 and 100 micrograms), cimetidine (50 and 100 micrograms), ketanserin (50 and 100 micrograms) or procaine (100 micrograms). The selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, BHT-920, injected i.c.v. (5-50 micrograms) also produced a dose-dependent pressor response which was abolished by either anesthesia or central pretreatment with yohimbine, but not with prazosin, whereas the selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist, methoxamine (10-100 micrograms i.c.v.), caused a slight increase in mean blood pressure only at higher doses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Cardiac hyperactivity and its consequent metabolically induced coronary vasodilation (MCD) were studied in isolated, perfused, electrically paced rat hearts. The alpha-adrenoceptor agonists, phenylephrine and methoxamine, produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the inotropic responses to noradrenaline, dobutamine, isoprenaline, tyramine, and glucagon, while relatively potentiating their MCD reactions. This inhibition was unrelated to the alpha-agonists' known inotropic action and was not affected by catecholamine depletion of the heart. Withdrawal of the alpha-agonists or administration of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists phentolamine, phenoxybenzamine, or prazosin returned the inotropic and MCD reactions to normal. Neither the MCD response to electrically induced tachycardia nor the inotropic reactions produced by calcium chloride were affected by alpha-adrenoceptor agonists or antagonists. Alone, alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists were shown to potentiate the inotropic responses to noradrenaline and isoprenaline while the MCD was relatively diminished. The responses to glucagon were unaltered by alpha-antagonists. We postulate that myocardial reactivity to sympathetic stimulation can be modulated through alpha-adrenoceptors by the inhibition of processes that mediate cardiostimulation at post-beta-adrenoceptor sites, together with facilitation of those leading up to MCD. Accordingly, this modulation would act to prevent ischaemic damage to the heart by acting to limit the inotropic responses to increasing sympathetic stimulation while maximizing the blood supply to the myocardium."
"Contractile responses of Müller's smooth muscle to alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation were evaluated in anesthetized Spontaneously Hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats on postnatal days 1-80. Force of contraction elicited by methoxamine, tyramine and electrical stimulation of the preganglionic nerve in SHRs was significantly less than that of WKY rats throughout development. alpha-Adrenoceptor sensitivity, as evaluated by methoxamine ED50, was comparable at 10 and 20 days of age, but receptor sensitivity was decreased in SHRs at 40 and 80 days. Elimination of impulse activity by decentralization of the superior cervical ganglion on postnatal day 3 resulted in a decrease in force of contraction of about 25\% in both strains, and responses in SHRs remained significantly below those of WKY rats. Decentralization increased adrenoceptor sensitivity in both groups, and differences between strains were eliminated. It is concluded that the smaller adrenoceptor-mediated contractions in SHRs are an intrinsic property of the muscle while adrenoceptor subsensitivity is a consequence of elevated sympathetic nerve activity in this strain."
"Alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction was studied in the in situ, autoperfused pulmonary circulation of the open-chest anesthetized dog utilizing selective alpha adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists. Animals were pretreated with propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.) to eliminate beta adrenoceptor-mediated effects in the pulmonary circulation. Blood was withdrawn from the right femoral artery and transferred, via a peristaltic pump, to the pulmonary arterial branch supplying the left diaphragmatic lobe of the lung. The flow rate of the pump was set so that the perfusion pressure in the lobe was equal to resting diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (10 +/- 1 mm Hg). Under conditions of constant left atrial pressure and pulmonary blood flow, intralobar administration of alpha adrenoceptor agonists elicited increases in perfusion pressure of the lobe, reflecting changes in pulmonary vascular resistance. Intralobar administration of the selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine and the selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist B-HT 933 elicited dose-dependent increases in lobar perfusion pressure, as did the nonselective alpha adrenoceptor agonist norepinephrine. Prazosin (100 micrograms/kg i.v.), a selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, inhibited pulmonary vasopressor responses to methoxamine and norepinephrine without altering significantly the response to B-HT 933. Rauwolscine (100 micrograms/kg i.v.), a selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, inhibited the response to B-HT 933 and norepinephrine with little effect on methoxamine. Intralobar administration of tyramine to evoke the release of endogenous norepinephrine resulted in dose-dependent increases in lobar perfusion pressure. The response to tyramine was inhibited selectively by prazosin with little effect of rauwolscine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"The subtypes of postjunctional alpha adrenoceptors in the feline pulmonary vascular bed were studied by using selective alpha-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists. Under conditions of controlled pulmonary blood flow and constant left atrial pressure, intralobar injections of the alpha 1 agonists phenylephrine and methoxamine, and the alpha 2 agonists UK 14,304 and B-HT 933, increased lobar arterial pressure in a dose-related manner. Prazosin, an alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, reduced responses to phenylephrine and methoxamine to a greater extent than responses to UK 14,304 and B-HT 933. Yohimbine, an alpha 2 blocker, decreased responses to UK 14,304 and B-HT 933 without altering responses to phenylephrine or methoxamine. The same pattern of blockade was observed in animals pretreated with 6-hydroxydopamine, an adrenergic neuronal blocking agent. However, in propranolol-treated animals, prazosin antagonized responses to phenylephrine and methoxamine without altering responses to UK 14,304 or B-HT 933, and the selectivity of the blocking effects of yohimbine were preserved. Responses to intralobar injections of norepinephrine (NE) were markedly decreased by prazosin, whereas yohimbine had only a small effect. These data suggest the presence of both postjunctional alpha 1 and alpha 2 adrenoceptors mediating vasoconstriction in the pulmonary vascular bed. These results also indicate that the vasoconstrictor responses to injected NE in the cat pulmonary vascular bed result mainly from activation of alpha 1 adrenoceptors."
"Rats dehydrated for 8 days and subsequently rehydrated were given intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) methoxamine hydrochloride (MX) or dihydroergotamine methanosulphonate (DHE), each in a daily dose of 10 micrograms dissolved in 10 microliter of 0.9\% sodium chloride. A single dose of MX injected to normally hydrated animals increased the release of hypothalamic and neurohypophysial vasopressin but did not affect significantly the oxytocic activity in the hypothalamus as well as in the neurohypophysis. Under conditions of dehydration MX did not influence the hypothalamic vasopressin content but it stimulated the neurohypophysial vasopressin depletion. On the contrary, MX distinctly inhibited the decrease of hypothalamic and neurohypophysial oxytocin content in dehydrated animals. In rehydrated animals MX restrained some what the renewal of hypothalamic vasopressin and oxytocin storage but intensified this process in the neurohypophysis. A single dose of DHE decreased the vasopressin content in the hypothalamus as well as the oxytocin content both in the hypothalamus and neurohypophysis. Under conditions of dehydration DHE stimulated the depletion of hypothalamic vasopressin and oxytocin. On the contrary, DHE strongly inhibited the depletion of oxytocin in the neurohypophysis of dehydrated rats. DHE restrained the renewal of hypothalamic vasopressin and oxytocin stores as well as intensified this process in the neurohypophysis of subsequently rehydrated rats."
"In man, the occurrence of constrictions of large coronary arteries accompanied by transient myocardial ischemia is now well established. However, the role of neural factors involved in such coronary artery spasms is still a matter of conjecture. A consistent reduction (9 +/- 2\%) of the diameter of the large coronary arteries can be obtained in the conscious dog with alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation with methoxamine in spite of the concomitant pressor rise (65 +/- 5\%). Smaller reductions in coronary diameter can be obtained with electrical efferent sympathetic stimulation in anesthetized dogs. The diameter of a conduit artery such as the aorta can be reduced (5\%) by reflex increases in sympathetic efferent activity: therefore it is not unlikely that similar neural influences might be exerted on the coronary tree as well. In normal life, stressful situations, such as emotion or exercise, will be accompanied by a drastic increase in sympathetic drive to the heart, together with a marked increase in coronary flow. The latter will induce an endothelial mediated vasodilation; however the net effect on coronary size of these two potentially opposite mechanisms is as yet unexplored. In the laboratory, intracoronary bradykinin and regional myocardial ischemia initiate a reflex increase in sympathetic activity to the heart; in the clinics acute myocardial ischemia can be accompanied by signs of sympathetic overactivity. The extent to which such increases in sympathetic activity, could play a role in the control of coronary tone and hence in the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease, is still under investigation."
"Three types of vasorelaxants were used to test the responses of canine veins isolated from 13 different sites: isoproterenol, papaverine and nitroglycerin. Strips were preconstricted with methoxamine (5 X 10(-6)-10(-5) M), KCl (50 mM) and PGF2 alpha (1 microgram/ml), and were relaxed by cumulative addition of relaxants. Isoproterenol caused more than 80\% relaxation after preconstriction with methoxamine in cephalic, external jugular, azygos, renal, femoral, lateral saphenous veins and the supradiaphragmatic and infrarenal portions of the inferior vena cava, all of which are veins of the body wall. Pulmonary and splenic veins also showed marked relaxation with isoproterenol. However, maximal relaxation responses of portal, mesenteric veins and segment C of the inferior vena cava (a portion between liver and renal veins), which are embryologically related to the digestive tube, were less than 30\%. Similar regional differences in the relaxation responses to isoproterenol were obtained after preconstriction with KCl or PGF2 alpha. Papaverine and nitroglycerin caused nearly uniform relaxation in all veins, although relaxations of segment C of the inferior vena cava were slightly less than those of other veins. These results indicated that there is a regional difference in the relaxation responses of the canine venous system to isoproterenol, and such a difference may be related to its embryogenesis."
"The type of adrenoceptor involved in the contractile response to catecholamines in smooth muscle strips isolated from rainbow trout stomach was determined. Noradrenaline (10 nM-10 microM) and adrenaline (10 nM-3 microM) caused non-sustained contractions which were markedly decreased by phentolamine (5.4 microM) but not by carteolol (5 microM). Phenylephrine (1 microM-1 mM) was less effective in causing muscle contraction and methoxamine produced no contraction. Clonidine (100 nM-300 microM) caused no mechanical response but inhibited the contraction to noradrenaline or adrenaline but not acetylcholine or 5-hydroxytryptamine. Yohimbine (10 nM-1 microM) decreased the contraction induced by noradrenaline or adrenaline but prazosin (1 microM) did not. Tetrodotoxin (780 nM) partially reduced the contraction induced by noradrenaline or adrenaline but atropine (500 nM) did not. In the presence of atropine (1 microM), electrical transmural stimulation caused frequency-dependent, tetrodotoxin-sensitive contractions. These results suggest that the contractile response induced by noradrenaline or adrenaline is mediated by alpha 2-adrenoceptors. It is also suggested that noradrenaline and adrenaline contract the smooth muscle by direct action and by indirect action through the non-cholinergic excitatory nerve."
"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation in children is not well studied; many of the current recommendations for advanced pediatric life support (APLS) are based on anecdotal experience rather than scientific study. The following are unique issues in APLS requiring a consensus decision: What are the best methods of vascular access and of drug delivery and dosages? What constitutes minimal paramedic training and equipment? There are also many shared controversies between APLS and ACLS, including the use of calcium, epinephrine vs isoproterenol, methoxamine, and bicarbonate. This article presents the scientific basis for these controversial issues and highlights areas where information is lacking. A discussion of these questions generated a consensus on some issues and hopefully will stimulate further study to answer the questions that were raised."
"The distribution of whole-body O2 supply during severe hypoxia and recovery and its relation to the regional distribution of O2 deficit and repayment was studied. Mongrel dogs were anesthetized, paralyzed, and ventilated to maintain an end-tidal PCO2 between 35 and 40 Torr. In one group, the alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors were blocked to eliminate neural and humoral adrenergic influences. In a second group, alpha-adrenergic receptors were stimulated to decrease O2 delivery by excessive vasoconstriction. In a third group, beta-adrenergic receptors were stimulated to increase O2 delivery. Whole-body and hindlimb muscle O2 uptake and vascular responses were measured during normoxic control, 15 or 30 min of severe hypoxia (9\% O2 in N2), and 20 or 30 min of normoxic recovery, respectively. The whole-body O2 deficit and excess O2 uptake in recovery were partitioned into muscle and nonmuscle areas. The data showed that neural or humoral influences had little effect on the regional distribution of the total O2 deficit and O2 excess in recovery. The O2 deficit could be decreased somewhat by increasing delivery, but the amount of excess O2 used in recovery was unaffected. This suggested that the excess O2 use in recovery was more a function of an energy deficit during hypoxia and not an O2 deficit."
"Effects of the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, were examined on the pressor and vasoconstrictor responses to stimulation of alpha-1 and alpha-2-adrenoceptors in chronically instrumented conscious dogs and Rhesus monkeys. Norepinephrine (NE), a mixed alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine (PE) and methoxamine (M), selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonists, and B-HT 920, a selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, were injected i.v. after ganglionic (hexamethonium), beta adrenoceptor (propranolol) and muscarinic receptor (atropine methyl bromide) blockade. In the dog, NE (0.1 microgram/kg i.v.), PE (1 microgram/kg i.v.), M (20 micrograms/kg i.v.) and B-HT 920 (1 microgram/kg i.v.) produced similar increases in mean arterial pressure (NE, 52 +/- 4 mmHg; PE, 42 +/- 4 mm Hg; M, 43 +/- 7 mm Hg; B-HT 920, 45 +/- 6 mm Hg) and total peripheral resistance (NE, 20.8 +/- 5.8 mm Hg/l/min; PE, 23.1 +/- 4.2 mm Hg/l/min; M, 18.2 +/- 2.1 mm Hg/l/min; B-HT 920, 24.8 +/- 7.1 mm Hg/l/min). Nifedipine (0.5 microgram/kg/min i.v.) caused a similar attenuation of the pressor (NE, -54 +/- 8\%; PE, -43 +/- 8\%; M, -49 +/- 6\%; B-HT 920, -56 +/- 8\%) and vasoconstrictor (NE, -66 +/- 11\%; PE, -52 +/- 9\%; M, -60 +/- 13\%; B-HT 920, -57 +/- 10\%) responses to each of the alpha-adrenoceptor agonists. Nifedipine also attenuated pressor responses to alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists similarly in conscious monkeys. Thus, in conscious dogs and monkeys, calcium channel blockade attenuates similarly both alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction."
"The positive inotropic effect (PIE) of beta-adrenoceptor stimulating agents in the mammalian heart is mainly due to an increase in slow Ca++ inward current (Isi) which in turn is probably the result of an increase in intracellular cAMP levels. The present paper is concerned with the alpha(probably alpha 1)-adrenoceptor-mediated PIE which differs from the response to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation in several points: it develops relatively slowly, is not accompanied by an abbreviation but instead by a prolongation of the contraction, is dependent on the frequency of stimulation, is increased in hypothyroidism and is not accompanied by detectable changes in cAMP and cGMP levels. In spite of the failure to elevate cAMP levels, alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation increases the magnitude, and decelerates the decay, of Isi. The alpha-adrenoceptor mediated increase in Isi is smaller than that of an equieffective (with respect to the PIE) concentration of isoprenaline. However, this effect conceivably contributes to the alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated PIE although other mechanisms (e.g. an increase in Ca++ sensitivity of the contractile proteins) are likely to be also involved. Recent experiments provide evidence that blockade of beta-adrenoceptors increases the density of myocardial alpha 1-adrenoceptors. This is in accord with the view that stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors by endogenous catecholamines may serve as a reserve mechanism under conditions of impaired beta-adrenergic influence."
"The role of presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors in modulation of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) release from vascular adrenergic nerves was investigated in the perfused mesenteric vascular bed of the rat. After treatment with 5-HT (10 microM) for 15 min, the vasoconstrictor response to periarterial nerve stimulation (PNS, 4 to 16 Hz, 2 msec in duration for 30 sec) was greatly potentiated without significantly affecting the pressor response to exogenously administered noradrenaline (0.5 nmol). The potentiating effect was more pronounced at low frequencies of PNS (4 and 8 Hz). The potentiation of the pressor response to PNS after 5-HT treatment did not occur in the presence of LY53857 (0.01 microM), a selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonist. The enhanced pressor response to PNS seen after 5-HT treatment was further exaggerated in the presence of clonidine (0.1 and 1 microM), a preferential alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, while methoxamine (1 and 10 microM), a selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, did not affect the enhanced PNS response. This effect of clonidine was more pronounced in low frequencies of PNS (4 and 8 Hz) and was abolished by LY53857 (0.01 microM). In the perfused mesenteric vascular bed labelled with [3H]-5-HT, PNS (8 Hz) evoked an increase of tritium efflux in the perfusate. The PNS-evoked tritium efflux was facilitated by yohimbine (0.1 to 1 microM), an alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, and prazosin, a selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, at a high concentration (1 microM), while LY53857 (0.01 to 0.1 microM) and a low concentration of prazosin (0.1 microM) had no effect on the tritium efflux. Clonidine (0.01 to 1 microM) produced a dose-dependent increase of PNS-evoked tritium efflux, while methoxamine (0.1 to 10 microM) was without effect. The monoamine uptake inhibitor, cocaine (10 microM) produced a significant inhibition of the PNS-evoked tritium efflux. The effects of clonidine and cocaine on the PNS-evoked tritium efflux were antagonized by yohimbine (1 microM). These results suggest that the release of 5-HT from adrenergic nerve endings by PNS is modulated by presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors."
"In a double-blind study in normal subjects, methoxamine, a highly selective agonist at alpha-1-adrenoceptors, significantly increased circulating ACTH and cortisol. The stimulant effect of methoxamine on cortisol secretion was dose dependent in the range 3.5-7 micrograms/kg/min, was abolished by concomitant administration of the strong alpha-1-adrenergic (and weak H1) antagonist thymoxamine but unaffected by the antihistamine, chlorpheniramine. In order to test whether the action of methoxamine on ACTH secretion was exerted centrally or peripherally, the effects of norepinephrine (NE), an alpha-1-agonist that does not cross the blood-brain barrier, were studied. Doses of NE (1-12 micrograms/min) that increased systolic blood pressure by amounts similar to the changes produced by methoxamine, did not result in any rise in plasma cortisol in normal subjects. The effect of methoxamine, which is more lipid soluble than NE, on plasma ACTH and cortisol, appears to be exerted on the CNS and not at the pituitary or via nonspecific peripheral mechanisms. In addition to its water solubility, NE differs from methoxamine in its beta-1-, beta-2- and alpha-2-agonist actions. However, prenalterol (2 mg) and salbutamol (250 micrograms), respectively beta-1- and beta-2-adrenergic agonist drugs, had no effect on the secretion of ACTH or cortisol and the alpha-2-antagonist yohimbine in an effective dose did not unmask a stimulant effect of intravenous NE on plasma cortisol. At high infusion rates, NE significantly inhibited cortisol secretion. Stimulation of central alpha-1-adrenergic mechanisms results in secretion of ACTH in man, presumably by increased release of a corticotropin-releasing factor."
"We compared the effects of alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists on vascular resistance, gluconeogenesis (GNG), and electrolyte excretion in pyruvate-perfused rat kidneys. Norepinephrine (NE) (15-60 nM) increased vascular resistance (2-19\%) and GNG (42-49\%) and decreased fractional excretion of Na (18-34\%), Cl (38-48\%), and K (13-27\%). Prazosin and yohimbine blocked the vasoconstrictor but not the antinatriuretic response. Prazosin revealed an antiphosphaturic and inhibited the gluconeogenic response. Propranolol blocked the effect on Na and Cl (66\%) and K excretion (100\%). Methoxamine (0.6-1 microM) maximally increased GNG (40-52\%) with little effect on vascular resistance (+0-9\%) and NaCl excretion (-0-11\%). Adding glucose to the perfusate increased methoxamine's effects on electrolyte excretion and vascular resistance. Mercaptopicolinate did not alter methoxamine's effects during pyruvate perfusion. Clonidine (0.1 microM) decreased phosphate excretion without vasoconstriction or antinatriuresis; 0.5-1 microM vasoconstricted and decreased NaCl excretion. Isoproterenol (0.1 microM) vasodilated and decreased Na (25\%), Cl (40\%), and K excretion (20\%). Thus alpha 1- and beta-receptors could account for the effect of NE on GNG and K reabsorption, respectively. Synergism of alpha 1, alpha 2, and beta were required for full antinatriuresis. Glucose increased alpha 1-stimulated vasoconstriction and antinatriuresis. Blocking alpha 1-receptors revealed an alpha 2-like antiphosphaturic response."
"Experiments were designed to examine some characteristics of an orally active antihypertensive agent, SGB-1534 on alpha-adrenoceptors in spinally anesthetized dogs. In the saphenous arterial bed perfused by a constant pump volume, saphenous nerve stimulation and bolus applications of norepinephrine and phenylephrine into the artery-evoked frequency- or dose-dependent increases (i.e. vasoconstriction) in perfusion pressure. SGB-1534 and prazosin infused i.v. significantly reduced the vasoconstriction in response to saphenous nerve stimulation and the two agonists. In the saphenous arterial bed, alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist potency of SGB-1534 on a weight basis was approximately 30 times greater than that of prazosin. Unlike SGB-1534 and prazosin, yohimbine failed to inhibit the vasoconstriction induced by phenylephrine, but instead potentiated the vasoconstrictor response to saphenous nerve stimulation. The equieffective doses of methoxamine and B-HT 920 given i.v. produced sustained pressor responses. SGB-1534 and prazosin applied i.v. in a cumulative way reduced dose dependently the pressor response to methoxamine but not that to B-HT 920. When the doses that blunted the sustained pressor response to methoxamine by 50\% were compared, the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonistic activity of SGB-1534 was nine times greater than that of prazosin."
"Responsiveness to endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine and A23187) and endothelium-independent (nitroprusside and 8-bromo cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate [cGMP]) vasodilators was examined in two vascular preparations from hypertensive and normotensive mice. CBA Agouti mice were made hypertensive by exposure to social stress in a complex population cage. After 2 months, the hindquarter vascular bed was pump-perfused at a constant flow with plasma substitute to evaluate changes in perfusion pressure, and helical strips of aorta were suspended in muscle baths for measurement of isometric force generation. Tissues were treated with methoxamine to induce contractile tone. Threshold dilator responses to acetylcholine were elicited at a significantly lower dose in the hindquarters of hypertensive mice than in those from normotensive mice, indicating increased vasodilator sensitivity. In contrast, vasodilator responsiveness to nitroprusside in hindquarters of hypertensive mice did not differ from that in hindquarters of normotensive mice. Aortas from hypertensive mice were more sensitive (lower ED50) to the relaxant effects of acetylcholine and A23187 than those from normotensive mice. The relaxant effects of nitroprusside and 8-bromo cGMP on aortas from hypertensive mice were not significantly different from those in normotensive aortas. Aortic strips that had been rubbed on the lumen surface with a wooden stick did not relax to acetylcholine or A23187. In aortas that were not initially contracted with methoxamine, acetylcholine and A23187 caused small contractions from baseline. The magnitude of these contractile responses were potentiated after removal of the endothelium, and the potentiation was greater in aortas from hypertensive mice. These results demonstrate an increased responsiveness to endothelium-dependent vasodilators in this psychosocial model of hypertension."
"To determine the role of endogenous vasopressin (AVP) in cardiovascular response to central alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation, alpha 1-agonist methoxamine or alpha 2-agonist clonidine was administered intracerebroventricularly (ICV) to conscious Long-Evans (LE) rats as well as Brattleboro rats with hereditary hypothalamic diabetes insipidus (DI). In LE rats, ICV methoxamine increased blood pressure (BP) and decreased heart rate (HR), while ICV clonidine caused initial hypertension associated with bradycardia followed by prolonged hypotension with tachycardia. In DI rats, however, ICV methoxamine had no detectable effect on BP and HR, whereas ICV clonidine produced greater hypotension than in LE rats together with less initial bradycardia. Plasma levels of AVP increased 5-15 fold by methoxamine but did not change by clonidine. The intravenous (IV) but not ICV pretreatment with AVP vascular receptor antagonist d (CH2)5 Tyr (Me) AVP significantly attenuated the cardiovascular effects of methoxamine in LE rat, while neither IV nor ICV pretreatment with AVP antagonist modulated the cardiovascular effects of clonidine. These results provide the evidence for the implication of endogenous AVP in the cardiovascular response to central stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors."
"Pre- and postjunctional effects of the alpha 1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin and the alpha 1- and alpha 2-selective adrenoceptor agonists methoxamine and 6-fluoronoradrenaline, respectively, were studied in skeletal muscle in situ. Prazosin reduced the vasoconstriction and enhanced the overflow of endogenous noradrenaline elicited by sympathetic nerve stimulation (1-4 Hz, 2 min); the threshold concentration was 10-100 times lower for postjunctional than for prejunctional alpha-adrenoceptor blockade. The enhancement of noradrenaline overflow by prazosin was not inversely frequency-dependent, as shown elsewhere for alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists. Thus, different mechanisms may be involved. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by diclofenac did not alter the stimulation-evoked noradrenaline overflow, indicating a minor importance of prostaglandin-mediated transjunctional mechanisms in the modulation of noradrenaline overflow. Methoxamine and 6-fluoronoradrenaline elevated the basal vascular tone and, at higher concentrations, reduced the stimulation-evoked noradrenaline overflow. Methoxamine was 20 times more selective than 6-fluoronoradrenaline for postjunctional receptors. Our results are compatible with a pre- and postjunctional localization of alpha 2-adrenoceptors and a predominantly, but not exclusively, postjunctional localization of alpha 1-adrenoceptors. The postjunctional selectivity for prazosin was less marked than previously reported from in vitro studies. Hence, care should be taken when extrapolating in vitro findings to the more complex in vivo situation."
"The effects of beta-blockade with propranolol and of alpha-adrenergic stimulation with methoxamine, a powerful alpha-agonist, on azygos blood flow and on systemic and hepatic haemodynamics were investigated in 26 cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension. Beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol (n = 12), evidenced by a significant reduction of heart rate (-17 +/- 1\%, P less than 0.001) and cardiac index (-17 +/- 2\%, P less than 0.001), caused a mild but significant decrease of hepatic venous pressure gradient (-10 +/- 2\%, P less than 0.05) and a marked fall of azygos venous blood flow (-31 +/- 5\%, P less than 0.05). Alpha-adrenergic stimulation with methoxamine (n = 14), manifested by a significant increase of mean arterial pressure (19 +/- 2\%, P less than 0.001), mimicked the effects of propranolol on hepatic venous pressure gradient (-10 +/- 4\%, P less than 0.05) and cardiac index (-11 +/- 2\%, P less than 0.001). However, azygos blood flow was not significantly reduced by methoxamine (0.7 +/- 0.1 vs 0.6 +/- 0.1 l/min). On the contrary, hepatic blood flow was significantly reduced by methoxamine (-19 +/- 4\%, P less than 0.01) but not by propranolol (-7 +/- 7\%, ns). Similarly, in 8 patients who received methoxamine after being beta-blocked by propranolol, azygos blood flow, that was markedly reduced by beta-blockade, did not experience a further reduction but increased slightly by alpha-adrenergic stimulation, while hepatic blood flow, that was not reduced by propranolol, decreased significantly during the subsequent methoxamine infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"The purpose of this study was to characterize the alpha 1- and alpha 2-noradrenergic receptor sub-types which could mediate the hypothermic response produced by norepinephrine (NE) and other alpha-noradrenergic agonists applied to the thermosensitive zone of the hypothalamus. An array of four guide tubes was implanted stereotaxically so that their tips rested just above the anterior hypothalamic, preoptic area (AH/POA) of the cat. Following post-operative recovery, a micro-injection of an agonist or antagonist of NE receptors or control CSF vehicle was given in a volume of 1.0-2.0 microliter in the AH/POA in each of the unrestrained cats. The alpha 1-noradrenergic receptor agonist, phenylephrine, but not methoxamine, applied to the AH/POA produced a dose-dependent hypothermia of up to 2.0 degrees C. When applied similarly, the alpha 2-noradrenergic agonist clonidine, as well as norepinephrine, which acts on both alpha 1- and alpha 2-noradrenergic receptors, also induced a decline in the cat's core temperature of up to 1.5 degrees C. The hypothermic response of clonidine was inhibited by pre-treatment of the AH/POA with a micro-injection of the selective alpha 2-noradrenergic blocking agent, yohimbine. However, yohimbine given similarly in the cat's AH/POA potentiated significantly both the phenylephrine and norepinephrine-induced hypothermia. The combined alpha 1-, alpha 2-noradrenergic receptor antagonist, phentolamine, also injected into AH/POA inhibited the thermolytic response evoked by both phenylephrine and norepinephrine, whereas it was virtually ineffective against the clonidine-induced hypothermia. These results, therefore, strongly suggest that both alpha 1- and alpha 2-noradrenergic receptors subserve the coordinated thermoregulatory mechanisms in AH/POA which are required for the functional dissipation of body heat and the consequent evocation of hypothermia."
"The influence of treatment with the calcium entry blockers PY 108-068 (PY) and PN 200-110 (PN) on alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor mediated vasoconstriction has been investigated in the forearms of hypertensive patients. Changes in forearm vascular resistance (FVR) in response to the intra-arterial infusion of drugs were determined at the end of a placebo period and after 2-4 weeks of treatment with PY or PN. The drugs used were the selective agonists methoxamine (alpha 1) and B-HT 933 (alpha 2). During placebo, basal FVR was dose-dependently increased by methoxamine and B-HT 933. Basal blood pressure was lowered during PN but not during PY. Treatment with the calcium entry blockers did not influence the effect of methoxamine, but the vasoconstriction induced by B-HT 933 was attenuated by both of the calcium entry blockers. These results confirm the findings in animal studies that calcium entry blockers preferentially inhibit the alpha 2-adrenoceptor mediated vasoconstriction induced by selective agonists."
"The adrenergic regulation of cyclic GMP in isolated pinealocytes was investigated. In this cell, norepinephrine stimulates cyclic GMP and cyclic AMP greater than 100-fold by activating both alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors. beta-Adrenergic activation is a requisite event and is potentiated by alpha 1-adrenergic activation (Vanecek, J., Sugden, D., Weller, J. L., and Klein, D. C. (1985) Endocrinology 116, 2167-2173). The current study found that cholera toxin could substitute for beta-adrenergic agonists in stimulating pinealocyte cyclic GMP content, as has been found to be the case for cyclic AMP. Treatment with cholera toxin alone (1 microgram/ml for 90 min) had a small effect (2- to 4-fold increase) on cyclic GMP; addition of the alpha 1-adrenergic agonists, phenylephrine, cirazoline, or methoxamine to cholera toxin-treated cells rapidly (peak at 5 min) caused a further 30- to 300-fold increase. The alpha 1-adrenergic agonists had little effect by themselves at concentrations which potentiated the effects of cholera toxin. The potentiating effect of phenylephrine was inhibited nearly completely by an alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, but not by either an alpha 2- or beta-adrenergic antagonist. The purified cholera toxin subunits A and B did not stimulate cyclic GMP either alone or in the presence of phenylephrine. Furthermore, the potentiating action of phenylephrine was observed following 90 min but not 20 min of cholera toxin pretreatment. these results suggest that the regulation of cyclic GMP levels in the pineal gland involves an Ns-like GTP-binding regulatory protein. This is of interest because it is the first indication that cyclic GMP is regulated by such a GTP-binding protein in nonretinal tissue. It remains to be determined whether the mechanisms involved in the transmembrane regulation of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP in any other tissue are similar."
"Alpha-1 adrenoceptors were identified in the chick expansor secundariorum (ESM) smooth muscle by ligand binding (using [3H]prazosin) and organ bath techniques. We examined the effects of both reversible (6-hydroxydopamine-induced) and irreversible (surgical) noradrenergic denervation on alpha-1 adrenoceptors in the ESM. We also measured, in vitro, muscle contraction stimulated by the alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine and by 5-hydroxytryptamine. After both surgical and chemical denervation there were decreases in the number of [3H] prazosin binding sites in the ESM. After reversible denervation the decrease in receptor number persisted during a period in which there was extensive reinnervation of the muscle. At a time (7 days after injection) when the ESM was partially reinnervated the maximum methoxamine-stimulated response, but not that of 5-hydroxytryptamine, was reduced. After surgical (but not chemical) denervation there were increases in both protein content and wet weight of the muscle. However, at 7 days after denervation, these effects alone could not account for the observed decrease in receptor number. A small increase in sensitivity (1.4-fold) to methoxamine and a much larger increase in sensitivity (4.5-fold) to 5-hydroxytryptamine developed after surgical denervation but there appeared to be nonspecific decreases in maximum responses to the agonists. It is concluded that both surgical and chemical denervation produced a decrease in alpha-1 adrenoceptor number in the ESM; this may have contributed to the decrease in maximum contractile response. After surgical denervation a nonspecific supersensitivity developed in the ESM; it may be that a nonspecific contribution to methoxamine-stimulated responses was less apparent due to the loss of alpha-1 adrenoceptors."
"To examine possible arrhythmogenic effects of alpha adrenoceptor stimulation, we studied the effects of methoxamine 10(-6) M on arrhythmias and cellular electrophysiology during global myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion in isolated Langendorff perfused guinea-pig hearts. To avoid interference from release of endogenous catecholamines during ischaemia or reperfusion, experiments were performed using catecholamine depleted hearts (myocardial noradrenaline = 11\% of control). Catecholamine depletion markedly reduced the incidence of VT and VF during ischaemia and reperfusion and perfusion with methoxamine significantly reversed this. This arrhythmogenic effect of methoxamine was only observed during ischaemia or reperfusion, was independent of beta adrenoceptor blockade and H2 receptor blockade but was abolished by alpha adrenoceptor blockade with phentolamine. Catecholamine depletion blunted the ischaemia induced fall in action potential amplitude and Vmax and prolonged action potential duration and refractory period. Perfusion with methoxamine either partially or completely reversed these effects. Thus, alpha adrenoceptor stimulation has little effect on normally perfused myocardium, but may induce VT or VF during ischaemia or reperfusion."
"The effects of calcium antagonists, diltiazem and nicardipine (-6.0 to -4.0 log mol/l), on the contractile responses to noradrenaline, methoxamine and BHT-920 in isolated canine saphenous vein rings, were studied with isometric tension recordings. Concentration-effect curves to the alpha-agonists were obtained in the control state and in the presence of diltiazem or nicardipine. Propranolol (-6.0 log mol/l) was present in the bath throughout. Diltiazem had no significant inhibitory effect on the responses mediated by all three agonists. Nicardipine (-5.0 and -4.0 log mol/l) produced a small but significant inhibitory effect on the responses to noradrenaline and methoxamine while it had no effect on the response to BHT-920. The effects of nicardipine were greatest on the responses to methoxamine. These calcium antagonists appeared to have only small post-synaptic inhibitory effects on the contractile responses to alpha-agonists in the canine saphenous vein with nicardipine exerting a greater inhibitory influence than diltiazem."
"Previous investigations in our laboratory revealed subsensitivity of right ventricular tissue, isolated from one month STZ-diabetic rats, to the inotropic effects of isoproterenol. The present study was concerned with the characterization of this subsensitivity phenomenon. Observations of supersensitivity to methoxamine accompanied by decreased responsiveness to glucagon without a change in responsiveness to forskolin suggested a specific effect of diabetes on pathways involving receptor-mediated activation of adenylate cyclase. Radioligand binding analysis further revealed a specific decrease in the population of the high affinity state of the beta-adrenoceptor. Since the high affinity receptor state is a necessary intermediate for adenylate cyclase activation and enhanced myocardial contractility, it is proposed that the specific decrease in the high affinity population of the beta-adrenoceptor contributes to myocardial subsensitivity to isoproterenol observed in the diabetic animals. It is further proposed that the decrease in receptor population is related to increases in circulating epinephrine levels which were evident in the diabetic animals."
"A comparison was made of contractile responses to alpha-adrenoceptor agonists in the rat aorta and in the rat isolated perfused femoral artery. Dose-response curves were constructed to noradrenaline (alpha 1/alpha 2), methoxamine (alpha 1-selective) and B-HT 920 (alpha 2-selective). Methoxamine behaved as a full agonist in both tissues as compared with noradrenaline, while B-HT 920 was only a partial agonist in the aorta and produced small responses in the femoral artery preparation which were not dose-dependent. pA2 or -log KB values were calculated for prazosin and idazoxan against noradrenaline and methoxamine. Similar -log KB values for prazosin against both agonists were obtained in both tissues, while idazoxan was approximately ten times more potent in the femoral artery preparation than in the aorta. These results suggest that the aorta contains a single population of alpha 1-adrenoceptors, while the perfused femoral artery preparation contains predominantly alpha 1-adrenoceptors but also a small population of alpha 2-adrenoceptors."
"Alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction was studied in the in situ, autoperfused pulmonary circulation of the open-chest anesthetized dog under conditions of normal and elevated pulmonary vascular tone. Under conditions of normal pulmonary vascular tone (10 +/- 1 mm Hg), methoxamine, a selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist, and B-HT 933, a selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, elicited maximal increases in lobar perfusion pressure of 5 and 2 mm Hg above resting pulmonary tone, respectively. When pulmonary vascular tone was elevated progressively with the thromboxane mimetic, U-46619, serotonin or PGF2 alpha, alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated pulmonary vasoconstrictor responses to methoxamine were unaffected, whereas alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated pulmonary pressor responses to B-HT 933 were enhanced. Overall the response to B-HT 933 was enhanced 4-fold when pulmonary perfusion pressure was elevated to 19.8 +/- 0.8 mm Hg with U-46619 and almost 5-fold when elevated to 27.0 +/- 1.2 mm Hg. Pulmonary vasoconstrictor responses to angiotensin II were unaffected by elevated pulmonary vascular tone. Enhanced responsiveness of B-HT 933 to elevated pulmonary vascular tone was antagonized by the selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, rauwolscine (100 micrograms/kg i.v.), and unaffected by the selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (100 micrograms/kg i.v.). When canine intralobar pulmonary veins were studied in vitro they contracted to B-HT 933 whereas intralobar pulmonary arteries did not respond. These data indicate that alpha-2 adrenoceptor responsiveness is enhanced markedly and selectively under conditions in which pulmonary vascular tone is elevated."
"We investigated in rats whether alterations in noradrenergic function caused by 6-hydroxydopamine or alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists would modify the susceptibility of the brain to electroencephalographic seizures induced by intrahippocampal infusion of quinolinic acid. 6-Hydroxydopamine depletion of norepinephrine facilitated the expression of seizures while alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation by clonidine had either proconvulsant (0.1 mg/kg) or anticonvulsant (from 0.5 to 2 mg/kg) effects. Clonidine's anticonvulsant activity (0.5 mg/kg) was mimicked by methoxamine given intrahippocampally (10 micrograms), and antagonized by prazosin (1 mg/kg), whereas both yohimbine (5 and 10 mg/kg) and piperoxane (5 mg/kg) had no significant effect. Seizure facilitation induced by clonidine (0.1 mg/kg) was blocked by yohimbine (10 mg/kg). Systemic (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg) or intrahippocampal (10 and 20 micrograms) isoproterenol and propranolol (10 mg/kg) had no effect. Spiking activity and neurotoxicity induced by quinolinic acid were unaltered by treatments which protected against convulsions. Modulation of quinolinic acid-convulsive activity by alpha-adrenoceptor subtypes appears to be selective and complex, since alpha 1-type activation reduces seizures while alpha 2-type stimulation has proconvulsant effects."
"The object of this study was to determine suitable experimental conditions for the pharmacological evaluation of cardiac alpha-adrenoceptors. Atrial and ventricular preparations of the guinea pig and rat were employed, and the alpha-adrenoceptor responsiveness was compared with the binding of the alpha-adrenoceptor radioligand [3H]prazosin in membranes prepared from these cardiac regions. The experimental variables examined were the pacing frequency, bath temperature, choice of agonist, and cardiac region. In guinea pig atria the optimum alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated positive inotropic response to phenylephrine was at 32 degrees C and a pacing frequency of 1 Hz. A comparison of phenylephrine with methoxamine showed that the former yielded biphasic concentration-response curves in guinea pig left atria; the lower portion was alpha-adrenoceptor mediated and the upper, more substantial portion, was beta mediated. Methoxamine produced monophasic curves due entirely to alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation and was therefore used for comparisons between rat and guinea pig tissues. Of the guinea pig tissues, only the left atrium produced positive inotropic responses. Negative chronotropy was obtained with right atria and negative inotropy with ventricular strips and papillary muscles. The rat tissues all responded with positive responses, the largest maximum being in the left atrium. Binding data showed a larger number of alpha-adrenoceptors in the rat tissues, of which the ventricles had the greatest number. The lack of response of guinea pig ventricular tissues was therefore reflected in the low binding. From this study, the most appropriate model for characterizing cardiac alpha-adrenoceptors is therefore the rat left atria at 32 degrees C and paced at 1 Hz with methoxamine as the agonist."
"In rabbit aorta, pretreatment with KT-362 (KT; 10(-6) and 10(-5) M) inhibited contractile responses to norepinephrine (NE; 3 X 10(-9)-10(-5) M) and methoxamine (10(-7)-10(-4) M) but failed to affect responses to potassium (10-70 mM). KT (10(-5) M) partially inhibited Ca++-induced contractions in K+-depolarized aorta pre-equilibrated in a Ca++-free medium. After incubation of tissues for 30 min in a Ca++-free medium containing EGTA (0.2 mM), residual responses to NE and methoxamine were inhibited by KT (10(-6)-10(-4) M) and nitroglycerin (10(-5) M), but not by nifedipine, verapamil or diltiazem (all 10(-5) M). The inhibitory action of a combined treatment with KT and nitroglycerin (both 10(-5) M) on the residual response to NE was also much greater than that of either agent alone. In a Ca++-free medium, the residual caffeine-induced contraction of rabbit iliac artery was inhibited by KT (10(-5)-10(-4) M) but not by nifedipine (10(-5) M). The inhibitory action of KT on the residual responses to methoxamine and caffeine in a Ca+-free medium was much greater than that of nitroglycerin. In a Ca++-free medium with low EGTA (0.01 mM), D600 (10(-5) M) and NE (3 X 10(-7) M), the addition of Ca++ (2 mM) resulted in a tonic contraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"The effect of age on cholinergic endothelium-mediated relaxation was examined in vitro using blood vessels from Fischer 344 rats ranging in age from 1 to 27 months. Although no differences were seen in contractile response to alpha adrenergic agonists, both aortic ring segments and perfused caudal arteries showed an increase in sensitivity of endothelium-mediated relaxation to the cholinergic agonist methacholine. This increase in sensitivity occurs between the ages of 6 and 12 months, with no further significant increase in sensitivity up to 27 months of age, suggesting it is a consequence of growth and development rather than old age. No difference with age in cholinergic relaxation was observed in the perfused mesenteric bed, indicating either no change of sensitivity in smaller resistance vessels or an effect that is hidden in this more complex perfused system. In contrast to findings with cholinergic stimulation, responses of the perfused caudal artery to the calcium ionophore A23187 were not altered with age. This suggests that the alteration with age in response to methacholine involves the muscarinic receptor or receptor-coupling mechanism rather than the generation of, or response to, endothelium-derived relaxing factor."
"The role of circulating bradykinin in the regulation of cardiovascular homeostasis was studied in the normotensive conscious rat using a competitive antagonist of bradykinin at the receptor level. This antagonist (B4162) was administered intravenously as a bolus dose of 400 micrograms. This dose was shown to effectively block the hypotensive effect of exogenous bradykinin (2.5 micrograms) for at least 5 min. The bradykinin antagonist was administered at the end of an infusion of angiotensin II (1 ng/min, n = 5, or 12.5 ng/min, n = 6), of methoxamine (0.5 micrograms/min, n = 5, or 4 micrograms/min, n = 6), of lysine vasopressin (0.25 mUI/min, n = 11) or of saline (10 microliter/min, n = 7). The bradykinin antagonist did not change the mean arterial pressure of the control rats. The low doses of angiotensin II and of methoxamine did not have an effect on mean blood pressure. The bradykinin antagonist however increased mean blood pressure of these rats within 1 min by 10 +/- 2 (p less than 0.01, mean +/- SEM) and by 12 +/- 3 (p less than 0.01) mmHg, respectively. The large dose of angiotensin II raised mean blood pressure from 127 +/- 3.6 to 142 +/- 4.9 mmHg and that of methoxamine from 130 +/- 2 to 146 +/- 5 mmHg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Contractility responses of mice atria to alpha-adrenergic agonists (methoxamine and clonidine) were studied. The alpha-adrenergic agonists increased the rate of force development (dF/dt) and decreased contractile frequency. The positive inotropic effect was mediated through cardiac alpha-adrenoceptors, while the negative chronotropic effect involved parasympathetic activation. Blockers of phospholipase C inhibited both the positive inotropic and the negative chronotropic effects of the alpha-adrenergic agonists. Inhibitors of phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase activity attenuated the positive inotropic effect of the agonists without modifying the negative chronotropic effect."
"Saliva secreted in response to methoxamine and pilocarpine was collected from the cannulated ducts of both parotid glands of male and female rats at weekly age intervals from three to 10 weeks, and at 3.5, 8, and 15 months of age. It was analyzed for the concentrations of protein, potassium, calcium, inorganic phosphate, and for amylase activity. The type of protein were determined electrophoretically, and an amino acid analysis of the total protein was also carried out. The wet weights of the glands increased substantially up to eight weeks of age, then reached almost plateau values, and finally tended to decrease at 15 months of age in both sexes. The salivary volumes secreted in response to methoxamine and pilocarpine were positively correlated with the parotid gland weights in both sexes. The concentrations of protein, potassium, and inorganic phosphate were inversely related to the salivary flow rates only at relatively low rates of flow. The amylase activity was positively correlated with the concentration of protein, independent of the nature of the stimulus, age, and sex. With methoxamine as a stimulus, the amylase activity was positively correlated with the concentration of calcium, independent of age and sex. The types of protein and amino acid concentrations were independent of the nature of the stimulus, age, and sex up to 15 months of age. However, in parotid saliva of several rats at 8 and 15 months of age, unusual proteins were observed electrophoretically, independent of the nature of the stimulus and sex."
"In rabbits methoxamine reversed the vasopressor effect of St 587 and abolished the EEG synchronizing action of St 587. The interaction on the blood pressure could be ascribed either to the different chemical structures of St 587 and methoxamine or to partial agonistic properties of St 587. The interaction on the EEG appears to be more complex."
"The continuous measurement of cardiac output in conscious rats is difficult. Previously, Doppler flow probes have been applied to the ascending aorta by means of silicone cuffs. The placement of these cuffs can conceivably introduce errors engendered by the destruction of nerve fibers that are important in cardiac autonomic innervation. We report a novel method of Doppler flow-probe attachment directly to the ascending aorta by means of a polyacrylic cement. When we compared the response with baroreceptor activation with methoxamine and nitroprusside in conscious rats equipped either with probes attached via cuffs or directly via cement, we observed that animals equipped with cuffs failed to give the expected cardiac output and heart rate responses after nitroprusside administration. In contrast, animals that had their probes attached with cement displayed the expected responses. The data not only show that probes applied with cement give a result superior to probes attached with cuffs but also verify the suspicion that the ascending aorta is associated with nerve fibers that are important in mediating baroreceptor responses."
"Noradrenaline (NA) was applied to the solution bathing the cavy cerebellar vermis in vitro and the responses of 98 neurons were recorded extracellularly. Two thirds (23/35) of the responses were excitations and the remaining third were inhibitions. The lowest concentration of NA with which responses could be obtained was 10(-11) M NA. Responses were generally transient and occurred with a mean latency of 61 +/- 8 sec. The excitation was generally direct as most responses (9/11) survived synaptic blockade. The excitations were thought to be mediated by alpha 1 receptors because they could be mimicked by phenylephrine and antagonised by prazozin."
"Cardiac baroreflex sensitivity (BRS; i.e. the slope of the line relating change in pulse interval to change in systemic arterial pressure) was assessed in response to an increase in mean blood pressure (MBP) evoked by methoxamine or a decrease evoked by sodium nitroprusside. Measurements were made in Long Evans (i.e. control) and in Brattleboro (i.e. vasopressin (AVP)-deficient) rats, following acute and chronic intravascular catheterization, and in water-replete and water-deprived states (the latter designed to reduce plasma volume and activate AVP-dependent mechanisms (in Long Evans rats]. There were no differences between the corresponding values for cardiac BRS in Long Evans and Brattleboro rats. Furthermore, water deprivation caused no significant changes in cardiac BRS in either strain. These results do not support the claim that absence of endogenous AVP in Brattleboro rats is associated with marked impairment of cardiac BRS, and indicate that chronic changes in circulating AVP do not cause systematic changes in cardiac BRS."
"New Zealand albino rabbits received classical conditioning training in which a 35-sec tone conditioned stimulus was paired with a bolus injection of methoxamine hydrochloride (Vasoxyl), an alpha 1-adrenergic agonist. Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) responses were recorded. Methoxamine produced a precipitous rise in BP and bradycardia as an unconditioned response (UR); pairings of tone and methoxamine over a 5-day period resulted in a gradually appearing tachycardia conditioned response (CR) which occurred shortly following tone onset. On the other hand, the BP CR was a pressor response. Accordingly, the HR CR was opposite in direction and, thus, apparently compensatory to the UR, whereas the BP CR was similar in direction to the UR. Neither of these cardiovascular changes were observed in control animals receiving either unpaired presentations of tone and methoxamine or tones paired with physiological saline. Most animals receiving either paired or unpaired infusions of methoxamine also showed consistent elevations in baseline HR as training progressed, relative to their respective day 1 levels, thus suggesting the development of compensatory HR CRs to the contextual cues associated with training."
"The contractile reactivity to norepinephrine, methoxamine, and verapamil of the perfused mesenteric vascular bed from sinoaortic denervated (SAD) and sham-operated (SO) rats was studied 3 to 30 days after surgery. A gradual but incomplete reduction of arterial hypertension was observed in SAD rats throughout the study. The norepinephrine- and methoxamine-induced dose-response curves were similar in both SAD and SO groups on day 3, but shifted to the left on days 7 and 15 and demonstrated a tendency to shift to the right at 30 days. Verapamil-induced vasodilation was similar in both groups. Enhanced mesenteric vascular responsiveness to endogenous catecholamines could contribute to the increased vascular resistance."
"1. Three experiments were conducted to examine whether mydriatic or miotic drugs instilled into one eye have any effect on the diameter of the pupil of the untreated fellow eye, in healthy volunteers. 2. In Experiment 1, the effects of four subjects, using photography in an illuminated room to assess pupil diameter. The drug evoked a dose-dependent mydriasis in the index eye which was accompanied by a simultaneous dose-dependent miosis in the fellow eye. 3. In Experiment 2, the same method was used to assess pupil diameter as in Experiment 1. The effects of mydriatic (methoxamine and tyramine) and of miotic (pilocarpine) drugs instilled into the fellow eye, were studied on the sizes of pupillary responses to the same drugs instilled into the index eye. The presence of a mydriatic drug in the fellow eye resulted in a decrease in the size of the mydriatic responses in the index eye. 4. In Experiment 3, the effects of three concentrations of phenylephrine hydrochloride (0.15-0.60 M) and of three concentrations of pilocarpine hydrochloride (0.002-0.008 M), were studied in darkness using an infra-red binocular television pupillometer, in seven subjects. Phenylephrine evoked dose-dependent mydriasis and pilocarpine evoked dose-dependent miosis. The pupillary responses of the index eye were not accompanied by any changes in the diameter of the pupil of the fellow eye. 5. It is concluded that drug-induced mydriasis in the index eye is accompanied by a consensual miosis in the fellow eye.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"To investigate the clinically important but controversial question of how hypertension during coronary occlusion affects infarct size 24 pigs underwent 1 h occlusion of the mid left anterior descending coronary artery and 24 h reperfusion and were randomised to one of three treatment groups. In group 1 blood pressure was increased during the occlusion period by an infusion of methoxamine; in group 2 tachycardia was induced by atrial pacing; and in group 3 no intervention was performed. The area at risk and infarct size were quantified by digital planimetry of slices of myocardium previously marked with fluorescein and with triphenyl-tetrazolium. Methoxamine maintained mean aortic blood pressure at 117 (SEM8) mmHg during occlusion, whereas the values were 80(6) mmHg in group 2 and 67(9) mmHg in group 3. Pacing increased heart rate to 146(1) beats.min-1 in group 2; it was 103(5) in group 1 and 99(8) in group 3. The pressure-rate product achieved was similar in groups 1 and 2 and significantly higher than in group 3. The pathological studies showed infarct size to be moderately but significantly larger in group 1 (14[3.5]\% of the left ventricle) and similar in groups 2 (10.5[3.9]\%) and 3 (10.1[2.2]\%). The ratio of infarct size to area at risk was also significantly higher (0.743[0.057]) in group 1 with no differences between group 2 (0.604[0.055]) and group 3 (0.613[0.027]). At similar pressure-rate product, infarct size was thus greater with hypertension but not with pacing alone, showing a deleterious effect of increasing blood pressure in this experimental model with negligible collateral blood flow."
"The effect of hyperthyroidism was investigated on the sensitivity of rat aortic and mesenteric arteries to the contractile effects of biogenic amines, K+ and Ca++. Supersensitivity to norepinephrine, methoxamine and clonidine was observed in the mesenteric artery. Methoxamine and clonidine are immune to disposition by neuronal and extraneuronal uptake, and supersensitivity to norepinephrine persisted in the presence of hydrocortisone and desmethylimipramine, suggesting that the supersensitivity was postjunctional in origin. In addition, reserpine pretreatment induced supersensitivity to norepinephrine in control mesenteric arteries, but in hyperthyroid mesenteric arteries no further increase in sensitivity was observed after reserpine pretreatment supporting a postjunctional mechanism. In the aorta, a small increase in sensitivity was observed to norepinephrine, no supersensitivity was detected to methoxamine and supersensitivity to norepinephrine was not apparent in the presence of hydrocortisone, suggesting a prejunctional mechanism. The existence of a small prejunctional component in the mesenteric artery also was indicated, as incubation with hydrocortisone attenuated the degree of supersensitivity after thyroid hormone pretreatment. In the mesenteric artery, postjunctional supersensitivity also was observed to 5-hydroxytryptamine. However, no increase in sensitivity was observed to KCl or CaCl2 suggesting that the postjunctional supersensitivity was not due to an increase in the sensitivity of the contractile apparatus, and was specific for receptor-mediated effects of agonists."
"The effects of dopaminergic (apomorphine, nomifensine, B-HT 920) and noradrenergic (methoxamine, clonidine, salbutamol) agonists on locomotor activity were investigated in rats submitted to acute (3 h) or repeated (3 h/4 days) immobilization stress. The stress-induced functional changes were monitored by the blood level of corticosterone and the number of lymphocytes as well as the brain utilization of NA and DA. The rats subjected to acute immobilization stress displayed 30 min later an enhanced locomotor activation after apomorphine, nomifensine, or methoxamine and reduced sedative effect of clonidine, salbutamol or B-HT 920. 24 h after the repeated stress only the locomotor responses to apomorphine, nomifensine, B-HT 920 and salbutamol were modified. Spontaneous locomotor activity was not significantly changed under the influence of stressful stimuli. Increased plasma corticosterone level, strong reduction of blood lymphocytes and enhanced NA and DA utilization in the brain of rats after acute stress, together with above mentioned results, suggest that short-lasting stress evokes (30 min later) significant functional changes not only in the blood but also in the brain: enhanced CA neurons activity as well as the increased alpha 1-adrenergic and DA-post-synaptic receptors responsiveness in parallel with reduced alpha 2 - and beta-adrenergic and DA-presynaptic receptors reactivity. On the other hand, 24 h after last session of repeated stress CA brain neurons activity was not changed, however DA and beta-adrenergic responsivity was farther modified. It is postulated that the stress conditions produce in NA and/or DA brain systems a state of readiness to locomotion activating stimuli."
"To evaluate left ventricular diastolic reserve during acute pressure loading, changes in mitral flow velocity patterns before and after the elevation of blood pressure were analyzed by pulsed Doppler echocardiography in 11 cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), nine cases of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and 11 control subjects. Systolic blood pressure was elevated 25\% above basal values by methoxamine infusion (0.01 mg/kg/min). Before and after methoxamine, left ventricular dimension and mitral flow velocity pattern were obtained by M-mode and pulsed Doppler echocardiography, respectively. The peak velocity in the rapid filling and atrial contraction phases and time-velocity integrals were measured from the flow pattern. After methoxamine, left ventricular diastolic dimension was significantly increased in all groups, from 43.8 +/- 4.7 mm to 47.4 +/- 4.9 mm in the control subjects, from 43.7 +/- 6.3 mm to 47.2 +/- 6.0 mm in HCM, and from 57.9 +/- 6.4 mm to 60.6 +/- 5.9 mm in DCM. Left ventricular systolic dimension was significantly increased from 48.6 +/- 8.4 mm to 52.8 +/- 8.3 mm in DCM, but not in the control subjects or HCM. The peak velocity in the rapid filling phase was significantly increased from 60 +/- 16 cm/sec to 69 +/- 14 cm/sec in the control subjects and tended to be increased from 44 +/- 13 cm/sec to 52 +/- 12 cm/sec in HCM. The extent of this increase tended to be less in HCM. However, the peak velocity in the rapid filling phase tended to decrease in DCM. There were no consistent trends of changes in the peak velocity in the atrial contraction phase in any groups. The mitral velocity integral increased from 502 Hz-sec to 621 Hz-sec in the controls and from 525 Hz-sec to 613 Hz-sec in HCM, but it did not increase in DCM. These findings suggest that there is impaired diastolic reserve during acute pressure loading in HCM and DCM and that the diastolic disturbance might be reflected in the early diastolic phase, rather than in the late diastolic phase."
"Intraperitoneal injections of noradrenaline or adrenaline into rats increased the proportion of pyruvate dehydrogenase in the active state in white adipose tissue; this effect of catecholamines was also apparent in streptozotocin-diabetic rats, showing that it was not due to an increase in serum insulin concentration. The catecholamine-induced increase in pyruvate dehydrogenase of white adipose tissue in vivo was completely blocked by prior injection of either the beta-antagonist propranolol or the alpha 1-antagonist prazosin. Cervical dislocation of conscious rats increased pyruvate dehydrogenase activity of white adipose tissue, which was prevented by prior injection of propranolol. Adrenaline (30 nM) activated pyruvate dehydrogenase in white adipocytes in vitro; the maximum effect of adrenaline required activation of both alpha 1- and beta-receptors. The results show that catecholamines activate pyruvate dehydrogenase of white adipose tissue both in vivo and in vitro and that this effect is mediated by a combination of alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic receptors."
"The relationship between mean renal artery pressure and renal venous-arterial plasma renin activity-difference (renin stimulus-response curve; RSRC) was studied in 15 conscious dogs by a stepwise reduction of renal artery pressure down to the lower limit of renal blood flow (RBF)-autoregulation. The RSRC has a flat section above threshold and a steep slope - indicating a 100\% increase of renin release per 2.5 mmHg - below a well defined threshold pressure (Pth). Pth may remain unchanged for 4 weeks. A reflex activation of the renal sympathetic nerves by common carotid occlusion increased Pth by 16.5 +/- 3.2 mmHg (P less than 0.01); this effect was abolished by intrarenal alpha-blockade (prazosin). A low dose intrarenal infusion of methoxamine, which did not change RBF, increased Pth by 8.5 +/- 0.7 mmHg (P less than 0.001). We conclude that in the resting conscious dog renal perfusion pressure is a powerful factor in the control of renin release. The renal sympathetic nerves modulate the pressure-dependent mechanism within the autoregulatory range of renal blood flow by an alpha-adrenergic adjustment of threshold pressure."
"We investigated the pressor sensitivities to vasopressin, angiotensin II, and methoxamine of intact and ganglion-blocked rats that had been treated 21 days earlier with streptozotocin or saline. No differences in blood pressure or heart rate responses to vasopressin or angiotensin II were found between the intact groups when these peptides were administered intravenously in equimolar doses. After ganglion blockade a significant enhancement in pressor responsiveness to both vasopressin and angiotensin II was observed in the control groups, but in the streptozotocin-treated animals no enhancement in pressor sensitivity to vasopressin was found. Furthermore, although a significant augmentation of the responses to angiotensin II was observed, it was smaller than that seen in the ganglion-blocked control group. Neither group showed enhanced pressor responsiveness to methoxamine. These results indicate that the previously observed diminished contributions from endogenous vasopressin and the renin-angiotensin system to blood pressure recovery following ganglion blockade in streptozotocin-treated rats may have been due, at least in part, to diminished pressor responsiveness."
"Electromechanical dissociation (EMD) is an organized electrical depolarization of the heart without synchronous myocardial fiber shortening and, therefore, without cardiac output. Patients in EMD have a poor prognosis for resuscitation and long-term survival. The beneficial effect in resuscitation of epinephrine, the adrenergic agent currently recommended, has been shown to depend on stimulation of alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction. The beta-adrenergic inotropic and chronotropic effects of epinephrine are theoretically detrimental by increasing myocardial oxygen consumption and subendocardial ischemia. The purpose of our study was to determine whether the pure alpha agonist methoxamine was superior to epinephrine in human beings in EMD as determined by survival at one hour. These two agents were compared in a prospective, randomized, and double-blinded study involving 80 patients with EMD of various causes seen in the emergency department and internal medicine inpatient service. The advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) algorithm (current at the time of our study) for resuscitation from EMD was used, with the blinded study drug (epinephrine 1 mg or methoxamine 10 mg) administered where the algorithm calls for epinephrine. Calcium and isoproterenol also were used in the majority of cases according to ACLS standards but never prior to the use of methoxamine or epinephrine. Survival data are summarized as: survival less than one hour, 22 patients receiving methoxamine, 22 receiving epinephrine; one to six hours, 15 patients receiving methoxamine, 13 patients receiving epinephrine; six to 12 hours, one patient receiving epinephrine; more than 24 hours but not surviving to discharge, three patients receiving methoxamine, two patients receiving epinephrine; and survival to discharge, one patient receiving epinephrine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"To identify genetic factors linked obligatorily to hypertension in the rat, pithed spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were compared with genetically similar (Wistar-Kyoto rats; WKY) and different (Sprague-Dawley) normotensive strains. The only variables that distinguished SHR from both WKY and Sprague-Dawley rats were a greater maximum pressor response to electrical stimulation of sympathetic outflow and decreased sensitivity to submaximal doses of the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist methoxamine (i.e., higher ED50). SHR had in common with Sprague-Dawley rats basal blood pressure after pithing plus adrenalectomy and the maximum pressor response to methoxamine; both these values were higher than those in WKY. All strains demonstrated equal sensitivity of the vasoconstrictor response to endogenous norepinephrine released by electrical simulation at submaximal frequency, even though sensitivity to the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor agonist was lower in SHR. The alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist rauwolscine attenuated the pressor response to electrical stimulation in SHR and WKY but increased it in Sprague-Dawley rats. The alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin attenuated the response more in SHR and WKY than in Sprague-Dawley rats. We conclude that 1) sympathetic hyperactivity is linked obligatorily to hypertension in SHR; 2) increased basal blood pressure and noradrenergic vasoconstrictor response are present in SHR, but they are not obligatorily linked to hypertension; 3) feedback inhibition of norepinephrine release is comparable in SHR or WKY and poorly developed compared with that in Sprague-Dawley rats; 4) decreased sensitivity of the pressor response to stimulation of vascular alpha 1-adrenergic receptors in SHR compensates partially for increased sympathetic activity or hyperinnervation, or both."
"The pharmacology of the spinal and peripheral adrenergic receptor-subtypes controlling the micturition reflex was studied in a chronic unanesthetized rat model by continuous infusion of saline in the bladder and cystometrography after intrathecal (i.t.) and i.p. injections, respectively. Due to the absence of a catheter in the urethra, the bladder contraction-sphincter relaxation coupling could be assessed very precisely. For each agent tested in this study, dose-response curves were established. Norepinephrine (i.p.), methoxamine (i.p.) and ST-91 (i.p. and i.t.) produced an increase in frequency of bladder contraction. A decrease in frequency was observed after i.p. injection of isoproterenol (30 micrograms) and terbutaline (300 micrograms). Phentolamine, yohimbine, propranolol (i.p. and i.t.), isoproterenol (i.t.) and methoxamine (i.t.) had little or no effects on frequency of contraction at the highest doses examined. In addition, norepinephrine (i.p.), isoproterenol (i.p. and i.t.), ST-91 (i.p.), terbutaline (i.p.), phentolamine (i.p.) and yohimbine (i.p.) produced some relaxation of the bladder outlet. Methoxamine (i.p.) produced an increase in tone of the outlet. Propranolol (i.p. and i.t.), methoxamine (i.t.), ST-91 (i.t.), phentolamine (i.t.) and yohimbine (i.t.) had little or no effects on the tone of the bladder outlet at the highest doses examined. Those observations suggest that peripherally, catecholamines modulate the frequency of bladder contraction (increase through alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors; decrease through beta-2 receptors), and the tonic activity of the bladder outlet (increase in tone through alpha-1 receptors; relaxation through alpha-2 and beta-2 receptors). At the spinal level, noradrenergic systems appear to modulate the frequency of contraction and sphincter tone through alpha-2 receptors. Isoproterenol effects after i.t. injection are thought to be due to systemic distribution. However, absence of effects after i.t. injection of adrenergic antagonists suggests that spinal adrenergic systems might not be active during a normal volume-evoked micturition reflex, but might be activated in special circumstances, such as the voluntary act of retaining urine."
"ICI 169,369 is a chemically novel 5-HT antagonist that has higher affinity for the 5-HT2 binding sites in rat cortex than it has for 5-HT1 sites (Ki 1.79 x 10(-8) and 1.58 x 10(-6) M, respectively). In isolated tissue preparations ICI 169,369 was shown to be a competitive antagonist of 5-HT on the rabbit aorta, pig coronary artery and rat caudal artery. In the latter preparation it had a similar pA2 value to ketanserin (pA2 8.18 +/- 0.5 and 8.42 +/- 0.06, respectively). Unlike ketanserin, which was inactive, ICI 169,369 was a non-surmountable antagonist at the rat stomach fundus 5-HT 'D' receptor, recently reclassified as 5-HTIC. It was inactive (greater than 10(-6) M) at the 5-HT3 receptors found in the isolated perfused rabbit heart and the myenteric plexus of the guinea-pig ileum. At receptors other than those for 5-HT (alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, beta 2, H1, H2 and muscarinic), ICI 169,369 was inactive at concentrations of either 10(-6) or 10(-5) M. Thus the profile of ICI 169,369 should make it useful in the analysis of the role of 5-HT in physiological and pathological states."
"The relationship between mitral inflow velocity patterns and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was evaluated using pulsed Doppler echocardiography in 34 cases of heart disease, without significant valvular regurgitation. Flow patterns in 19 of the 34 cases were also examined before and after the elevation of LVEDP by methoxamine infusion, 0.01 mg/kg/min. The ratio of the peak velocities in the atrial contraction phase to that in the rapid filling phase (A/R) and the ratio of mean acceleration rates to peak velocities in the rapid filling phase (ACR/R) were determined from the mitral flow patterns obtained by the apical approach. 1. ACR/R correlated significantly with LVEDP (r = 0.49), but A/R did not. LVEDP in six cases with normal A/R (0.5 to 1.0) was 8.3 +/- 2.9 mmHg (mean +/- SD). Among 19 cases with A/R of 1.0 or more and ACR/R less than 13 sec-1, LVEDP showed 10.2 +/- 3.8 mmHg. In eight cases with A/R of 1.0 or more and ACR/R of 13 sec-1 or more, LVEDP was 17.9 +/- 6.2 mmHg. The average value of LVEDP in two cases with A/R less than 0.5 was 18.5 mmHg. 2. When the LVEDP was elevated after methoxamine infusion, A/R within normal range increased in five of six cases and decreased in the remaining case. A/R more than 1.0 decreased in 10 of 11 cases and ACR/R tended to increase with increasing LVEDP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"The characteristics of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) were studied in 18 smokers with mild chronic air-flow limitation (CAL) by measuring responsiveness to inhaled histamine, methacholine (high dose), methoxamine (an alpha-adrenergic agonist), and histamine after ipratropium bromide. The response of the smokers to histamine was reproducible and in the same range as that found in asthmatics. The smokers were significantly less responsive to methacholine than to equimolar doses of histamine (p less than 0.001). The dose-response curves to methacholine reached a plateau or maximal effect after a 30 to 50\% fall in FEV1 in 14 of the 16 smokers challenged. Only 1 of the subjects responded to alpha-adrenoreceptor stimulation, and pretreatment with ipratropium bromide had no effect on the histamine dose-response curve. By comparing these results with previously published data from similar studies performed on asthmatic subjects, it is concluded that BHR in smokers with CAL has characteristics different from those that occur in subjects with asthma."
"Insulin (0.1 microM) and 1 microM epinephrine each increased the uptake and phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose by the perfused rat heart by increasing the apparent Vmax without altering the Km. Isoproterenol (10 microM), 50 microM methoxamine and 10 mM CaCl2 also increased uptake. Lowering of the perfusate Ca2+ concentration from 1.27 to 0.1 mM Ca2+, addition of the Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine (1 microM) or addition of 1.7 mM EGTA decreased the basal rate of uptake of 2-deoxyglucose and prevented the stimulation due to 1 microM epinephrine. Stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose uptake by 0.1 microM insulin was only partly inhibited by Ca2+ omission, nifedipine or 1 mM EGTA. Half-maximal stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose uptake by insulin occurred at 2 nM and 0.4 nM for medium containing 1.27 and 0.1 mM Ca2+, respectively. Maximal concentrations of insulin (0.1 microM) and epinephrine (1 microM) were additive for glucose uptake and lactate output but were not additive for uptake of 2-deoxyglucose. Half-maximal stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose uptake by epinephrine occurred at 0.2 microM but maximal concentrations of epinephrine (e.g., 1 microM) gave lower rates of 2-deoxyglucose uptake than that attained by maximal concentrations of insulin. The addition of insulin increased uptake of 2-deoxyglucose at all concentrations of epinephrine but epinephrine only increased uptake at sub-maximal concentrations of insulin. The role of Ca2+ in signal reversal was also studied. Removal of 1 microM epinephrine after a 10 min exposure period resulted in a rapid return of contractility to basal values but the rate of 2-deoxyglucose uptake increased further and remained elevated at 20 min unless the Ca2+ concentration was lowered to 0.1 mM or nifedipine (1 microM) was added. Similarly, removal of 0.1 microM insulin after a 10 min exposure period did not affect the rate of 2-deoxyglucose uptake, which did not return to basal values within 20 min unless the concentration of Ca2+ was decreased to 0.1 mM. Insulin-mediated increase in 2-deoxyglucose uptake at 0.1 mM Ca2+ reversed upon hormone removal. It is concluded that catecholamines mediate a Ca2+-dependent increase in 2-deoxyglucose transport from either alpha or beta receptors. Insulin has both a Ca2+-dependent and a Ca2+-independent component. Reversal studies suggest an additional role for Ca2+ in maintaining the activated transport state when activated by either epinephrine or insulin."
"Administration of haloperidol influences peripheral non-dopaminergic receptors. The sialagogue response of the submandibular glands of the rats to methacholine was enhanced by chronic administration of haloperidol. The binding of [3H]QNB to muscarinic receptors in the submandibular glands was not changed by chronic haloperidol. The supersensitivity of postsynaptic cholinergic receptors to drugs in haloperidol treated rats is not related to changes in the number or affinity of such receptors. This paper confirmed the sialagogue supersensitivity to adrenergic drugs related to an increase in alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the submandibular glands of haloperidol injected rats."
"The improvement in cerebral blood flow (CBF) during CPR after epinephrine administration has been attributed to epinephrine's alpha-adrenergic properties. Methoxamine, a pure alpha-1 agonist, has only been shown to be comparable to epinephrine in restoring circulation after cardiac arrest in a canine model. This study compares the effectiveness of equipotent doses of epinephrine and methoxamine in improving CBF during CPR after a prolonged cardiac arrest in a swine model. Twenty-five swine, weighing 15.9 to 28.2 kg, underwent instrumentation for regional CBF using tracer microspheres. CBF was determined during normal sinus rhythm. After 10 min of ventricular fibrillation, CPR was begun with a pneumatic compressor. CBF measurements were again made during CPR. After 3 min of CPR, the swine were randomized to receive 0.02 or 0.2 mg/kg epinephrine, 0.1, 1.0, or 10.0 mg/kg methoxamine. Five swine were allocated to each group. CBF measurements were determined after drug administration and compared using a Bonferroni multiple comparison procedure. A p-value less than .05 was considered statistically significant. This study demonstrated that, after a 10-min cardiac arrest, CBF was extremely low, averaging less than 7 ml/min X 100 g during external CPR. There were no clinically significant improvements in regional CBF after 0.02 mg/kg of epinephrine, or the two lowest doses of methoxamine. The addition of 10 mg/kg of methoxamine clinically improved blood flow only to the most caudal CNS structures, including the pons, medulla, and cervical spinal cord.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"The contractions evoked by norepinephrine (NE) and caffeine in Ca2+-free solution were determined using denervated caudal artery rings from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The magnitude of contractions produced by different concentrations of NE was significantly greater (P less than 0.05) in SHR caudal artery rings compared to WKY. The contractions evoked by NE in Ca2+-free solution were mediated primarily through the activation of postsynaptic alpha 1-adrenoceptors. In addition to alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation, caffeine also evoked significantly greater (P less than 0.05) contractions in Ca2+-free solution in SHR caudal arteries compared to WKY. From these observations it is concluded that intracellular Ca2+ pool (presumably sarcoplasmic reticulum, SR) is increased in SHR caudal arteries which, at least in part, may account for the increased contraction observed in response to NE and caffeine stimulation in the absence of extracellular Ca2+."
"A cross-circulation technique was developed in rats to distinguish central from peripheral cardiovascular actions of drugs. The right common carotid arteries were ligated, and the left common carotid arteries and left and right external jugular veins of two pentobarbital-anesthetized rats were connected with PE tubing so that peripheral blood from one rat, A, supplied the head of another rat, B, and then returned to the body of A, and vice versa, for peripheral blood from rat B. Each rat was artificially ventilated with O2, the chest was opened, and both subclavian arteries were ligated. The distribution of blood flow was verified by the microsphere technique. Prior to ligation of the subclavian arteries, blood flow from rat A supplied its own brain and both brain hemispheres but not the brain stem of rat B. Following subclavian artery ligation, blood flow from rat A did not supply A's brain, but supplied both hemispheres and the brain stem of rat B. The head of each rat was, therefore, rendered dependent on the carotid arterial blood supply from another rat. The i.v. injection of clonidine (25 micrograms/kg) into rat A significantly increased mean arterial pressure and slightly, but not significantly, decreased heart rate in rat A, whereas it significantly decreased mean arterial pressure and slightly, but not significantly, decreased heart rate in rat B. Conversely, i.v. injection of methoxamine (25 micrograms/kg) in rat A significantly increased mean arterial pressure and decreased heart rate in rat A, and significantly increased mean arterial pressure and slightly, but not significantly, increased heart rate in rat B. Therefore, this rat cross-circulation preparation can be used to separate the central and peripheral cardiovascular actions of drugs."
"Sympathetic hyperactivity has been implicated as an etiologic factor in postoperative ileus. The effects of methoxamine (alpha-agonist) and isoproterenol (beta-agonist) on colon contractions and blood flow were studied in nine monkeys. Phentolamine (alpha-antagonist) and propranolol (beta-antagonist) were used to block the effects of the appropriate agonist. Methoxamine caused a dose-related inhibition of colon contractions and a decrease in inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) blood flow. Isoproterenol caused a dose-related inhibition of colon contractions and an increase in IMA blood flow. The contractile and blood flow effects of methoxamine were blocked by phentolamine and those of isoproterenol by propranolol. Mechanical reduction of IMA blood flow by an amount equivalent to that observed with the highest dose of methoxamine caused no change in contractions in the segment of colon supplied by the IMA. Both alpha- and beta-agonists inhibit colon contractions and have the expected effects on IMA blood flow. The contractile and blood flow responses of the agonists can be blocked by appropriate antagonists. The blood flow changes are not responsible for the contractile changes. These results indicate that sympathetic hyperactivity may play a role in postoperative ileus."
"Recent studies in swine have shown that larger doses of epinephrine than those currently employed for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) significantly improve regional myocardial blood flow following prolonged cardiac arrest. The dose-response effect of a pure alpha-adrenergic agonist, methoxamine, on regional myocardial blood flow has not been investigated in this setting. This study compared the effect of high-dose epinephrine with graded doses of methoxamine on regional myocardial blood flow, oxygen delivery/utilization, and defibrillation rates during CPR. Twenty swine were instrumented for regional myocardial blood flow measurements using radiolabeled tracer microspheres. Measurements of regional myocardial blood flow, oxygen delivery, and oxygen consumption were made during normal sinus rhythm. Ventricular fibrillation was then induced. Following 10 minutes of ventricular fibrillation, CPR was initiated with a pneumatic compressor. Regional myocardial blood flow, oxygen delivery, and oxygen consumption were then measured during CPR. Following 3 minutes of CPR, the swine were allocated to one of four treatment groups (five per group): group I, epinephrine 0.2 mg/kg; group II, methoxamine 0.1 mg/kg; group III, methoxamine 1.0 mg/kg; and group IV, methoxamine 10.0 mg/kg. One minute after drug administration, regional myocardial blood flow, oxygen delivery, and oxygen consumption measurements again were made. Three and one half minutes after drug administration, defibrillation was attempted. Regional myocardial blood flow following drug administration was compared using an analysis of covariance. Epinephrine (0.2 mg/kg) significantly improved myocardial blood flow (P less than .002) for all tissues examined compared with all doses of methoxamine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"In order to investigate the effect of a rise in aortic pressure on coronary flow reserve and also on the difference of its effect according to the methods used to raise aortic pressure, this experiment was performed. Using 7 anesthetized dogs with heart rate held constant by a pacemaker, both the resting and the peak reactive hyperemic left circumflex coronary flow were measured following raising of the aortic pressure by either descending thoracic aorta constriction or methoxamine injection. The resting and peak reactive hyperemic coronary flows both increased linearly following the rise in aortic pressure. The magnitude of the resting flow increment and the resting coronary vascular resistance following raising aortic pressure did not differ significantly between the two different methods. However, the magnitude of the peak hyperemic flow increment and the peak hyperemic coronary vascular resistance following raising aortic pressure were significantly smaller with methoxamine injection than with aortic constriction. These data indicate that coronary flow reserve increases proportionally with a rise in aortic pressure. However, the magnitude of the increment of coronary flow reserve is smaller following an alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated rise in aortic pressure, because the maximal coronary vasodilation was reduced by alpha-stimulated coronary vasoconstriction."
"The vasorelaxant effects of acetate in arginine vasopressin (AVP)-contracted rat tail artery strips were examined in order to study mechanism of action. Dose-dependent relaxation by acetate was found in the clinically important range of 4 to 16 mM. Relaxation was not due to complexing of ionized calcium, persisted after mechanical removal of the endothelium, and was not altered by pretreatment with indomethacin. Although acetate also inhibited contraction by alpha-1 and alpha-2 agonists, the relaxant effect was not altered by destruction of sympathetic nerve terminals using 6-hydroxydopamine. The degree of relaxation in this model by various anions correlated with their lyotropic properties; however, the vasorelaxant effect of acetate exceeded that which would be expected on the basis of its position in the lyotropic series. The vasorelaxant effect of acetate was shared by other short-chain fatty acids that can be conjugated with coenzyme A (CoA), such as propionate and malonate. In contrast, a much lesser or absent relaxant effect was found with nonfatty-acid precursors of acetyl CoA, such as pyruvate, lactate, and alanine. The vasorelaxant effect of acetate was abolished by pretreatment with DIDS, an inhibitor of organic anion uptake, suggesting that cellular uptake of acetate is essential to its vasorelaxant action. The results suggest that the relaxant effect of acetate in vascular smooth muscle is non-specific, is not mediated by prostaglandins, does not depend upon the presence of either endothelium or the sympathetic nervous system, and may be due to metabolism of acetate to acetyl CoA with attendant conversion of ATP to AMP."
"The relative importance of VIP in reduction of vascular tone was studied in circular and longitudinal preparations of the VIP-innervated rat portal vein. Exogenous VIP inhibited the methoxamine-evoked contractures in the atropine-blocked preparations with a lower potency in the inner, circular (pD2 = 6.4 +/- 0.5, n = 6) than in the outer, longitudinal layer (pD2 = 7.7 +/- 0.1, n = 6). VIP was also a less efficient relaxant (intrinsic activity (alpha) = 0.60 +/- 0.16, n = 6) of the inner than of the outer layer (alpha = 1.00). The selective (salbutamol) and the non-selective (isoproterenol) beta 2-agonists completely relaxed the methoxamine contractures in both layers and the potency (isoproterenol) was higher in the inner (pD2 = 6.39 +/- 0.32, n = 6) than in the outer layer (pD2 = 5.67 +/- 0.34, n = 6). Plasma from the portal-mesenteric vein of anaesthetized, fasting rats contained 0.036 nM VIP (median, n = 17), that is, several orders of magnitude lower than the range of VIP concentrations relaxing the methoxamine contracted vein preparations via VIP receptors of the apamin-blockable category. The results support the hypothesis that alpha 1-adrenoceptor-induced contractions in the circular layer are predominately relaxed via beta 2-adrenoceptors while relaxation of the outer layer may occur via VIP receptors, probably activated by local release of the neuropeptide."
"The new inotropic agent milrinone has both vasodilator and inotropic cardiovascular effects, but the importance of these effects in patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) is controversial. The left ventricular (LV) end-systolic pressure-diameter relation was used to determine the independent inotropic effect of milrinone. Seven patients with New York Heart Association class III CHF were invasively monitored with right-sided heart catheters and radial arterial lines. M-mode echocardiography was used to measure LV dimensions. The effect of a 10-mg oral dose of milrinone on hemodynamic, echocardiographic and end-systolic variables was determined. End-systolic pressure was measured at the dicrotic notch of the arterial pressure tracing and end-systolic LV dimensions at the time of aortic valve closure. Methoxamine (n = 6) or nitroprusside (n = 1) was used to alter afterload so that the end-systolic pressure-diameter relation could be determined. Arterial vasodilation from milrinone was evidenced by a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (88 +/- 5 to 77 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.025) and an increase in cardiac index (from 2.7 +/- 0.2 to 3.2 +/- 0.2 liters/min/m2, p less than 0.025), with no change in heart rate (80 +/- 5 beats/min). Milrinone decreased preload as assessed by the pulmonary artery wedge pressure (from 17 +/- 2 to 10 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and end-diastolic LV diameter (from 7.4 +/- 0.4 to 7.0 +/- 0.4 cm, p less than 0.025).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Methoxamine, an adrenergic agonist with selectivity for the alpha 1-adrenoceptor, when administered intraperitoneally 10 minutes prior to mating tests (1 to 5 mg/kg), effected reductions in the ejaculatory threshold, evidenced by a decrease in the number of intromissions preceding ejaculation. In mounting tests after penile anesthetization, a test which specifically assesses sexual motivation, 3 mg/kg methoxamine was without a stimulatory effect. Further, in penile reflex tests (ex copula) 1 mg/kg methoxamine was without effect, whereas 5 mg/kg decreased the number of erections, cups and flips per test, and increased the incidence of seminal emission. These data indicate a facilitation of the ejaculatory mechanism, both in and ex copula, coupled with an inhibition of erectile responses for moderate doses of methoxamine. Treatment of male rats with the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine (0.25 mg/kg, IP, five minutes pretest) drastically reduced the number of animals exhibiting intromissive and ejaculatory behavior in mating tests. This suppressive effect of clonidine was not prevented by prior treatment with methoxamine (3 mg/kg, 10 minutes pretest and five minutes preclonidine). Further, ST-91, a polar analog of clonidine which does not readily enter the central nervous system, was without effect on male sexual behavior. Since (1) the effects of methoxamine administration are not of similar quality or magnitude to those reported earlier after yohimbine, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, (2) since concurrent stimulation of alpha 1- (by methoxamine) and alpha 2- (by clonidine) adrenoceptors is followed by a suppression of sexual behavior similar to that seen after clonidine alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"We tested the hypothesis that acute coronary artery hypertension may damage vascular endothelium and alter vasomotor responses to humoral agents. We examined effects of intracoronary infusion of the endothelium-dependent agent serotonin and two endothelium-independent agents, angiotensin II and methoxamine, on large coronary artery diameter in the blood perfused dog heart. Responses were examined before and 30 minutes after brief periods of coronary hypertension (200 mm Hg for 10 seconds to 15 minutes). In open-chest anesthetized dogs, the left anterior descending coronary artery was perfused at constant pressure. Coronary diameter (D) was measured with piezoelectric crystals. At a control perfusion pressure of 80 mm Hg, serotonin produced dose-dependent constriction of the large coronary artery (mean +/- SEM; delta D = -22 +/- 10 microns at 5 micrograms/min; -108 +/- 50 microns at 50 micrograms/min). Increasing perfusion pressure to 200 mm Hg increased flow 515 +/- 79\% and coronary diameter 509 +/- 9 microns. After 15 minutes of hypertension, when coronary diameter had returned to baseline values, the constriction of the large artery to serotonin was potentiated (delta D = -89 +/- 33 microns at 5 micrograms/min; -207 +/- 45 microns at 50 micrograms/min; p less than 0.05). Hypertension for 1-5 minutes potentiated constrictor responses of large coronary arteries for at least 2 1/2 hours. Removal of endothelium prevented effects of hypertension on constrictor responses of large arteries to serotonin. Hypertension did not alter constrictor responses to angiotension II (1 and 2.5 micrograms/min) or methoxamine (50 and 100 micrograms/min) or the dilator response to acetylcholine (40 micrograms/min). Acute hypertension altered endothelial morphology. There were small endothelial craters following 10 seconds of hypertension, and disruption of endothelial junctions with leukocyte adherence following 1-15 minutes of hypertension. We conclude that acute hypertension alters constrictor responses of large coronary arteries to serotonin by impairing endothelial function and not by directly affecting vascular smooth muscle. These effects of acute hypertension on vascular reactivity are selective in that they do not involve non-endothelium-dependent agents or the endothelium-dependent agent, acetylcholine. The effect of hypertension also persists long after pressure is restored to normotensive levels."
"This investigation was designed to determine whether the rate of isovolumic left ventricular pressure decline is affected by load in man. Fourteen patients were instrumented with micromanometer left ventricular and right atrial pacing catheters to maintain a constant heart rate during control conditions and infusion of methoxamine or nitroprusside. The isovolumic relaxation period was defined as the time from peak (-)dP/dt to 5 mm Hg above left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of the following beat. The rate of isovolumic relaxation was calculated as time constants (Tau) from the linear regression of natural log pressure vs time (Tln) and instantaneous (-)dP/dt vs pressure (TD), which includes a variable asymptote (PB). The mean heart rates and average (+)dP/dt values normalized at 40 mm Hg development pressure (DP40) did not differ significantly, despite 33\% and 43\% increases in left ventricular peak and end-diastolic pressures during the infusion of methoxamine (p less than .001 and p less than .01, respectively) and 24\% and 29\% decreases during the infusion of nitroprusside (p less than .001 and p less than .01, respectively). The average Tln and TD values were not significantly affected by these alterations in load. In two patients, an inverse linear relationship was demonstrated between decreases in Tau and increases in contractile state produced by an infusion of dobutamine, as shown by correlation of Tln and TD with (+)dP/dt/DP40 (r = -.88 and -.83, respectively). We conclude that the time constants of left ventricular isovolumic relaxation are unaffected by modest alterations in loading conditions in man when heart rate is maintained constant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"To evaluate whether the end-systolic pressure-dimension and stress-shortening relations are influenced by the drugs used for their assessment, we analysed the effects of angiotensin II (N = 30) and methoxamine (N = 10) in normal individuals. Serial measurements of left ventricular dimensions and wall thickness were performed by M-mode echocardiography; the end-systolic pressure was assessed by indirect, calibrated carotid pulse tracings. The end-diastolic dimension, which reflects preload, remained unchanged during the afterload challenge using angiotensin II, but increased significantly using methoxamine (P less than 0.001). Significant differences due to the agent used were observed for the end-systolic pressure-dimension relationship (P less than 0.002), the relation between end-systolic wall stress and fractional shortening (P less than 0.0002), and the relation between end-systolic wall stress and mean fibre shortening velocity (P less than 0.02). The extrapolated end-systolic dimension D0 at zero end-systolic pressure was significantly shifted to the left when using angiotensin II (P less than 0.02); this is considered to be due to its negligible effect on preload. Our data suggest that the assessment of the end-systolic pressure-dimension and stress-shortening relationships depends significantly on drug specific effects and the variation of preload during the afterload challenge. Based on these results, the use of angiotensin II is emphasized for the assessment of the end-systolic pressure-dimension and stress-shortening relationships."
"A series of 2-[(2-aminoethyl)thio]quinolines substituted at the 3-position with alkyl, aryl, or heteroaryl groups has been prepared in the search for novel and selective 5-HT2 antagonists. The affinity of the compounds for 5-HT1 receptor sites was measured by their ability to displace [3H]-5-HT from rat brain synaptosomes whereas the affinity for 5-HT2 receptor sites was measured by their ability to displace [3H]spiperone from synaptosomes prepared from rat brain cortex. The 5-HT2 antagonist properties of the compounds were measured in vivo by their antagonism of 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced head twitches in the mouse and by their antagonism of hyperthermia induced by fenfluramine (N-ethyl-alpha-methyl-m-(trifluoromethyl)phenethylamine hydrochloride) in the rat. The structure-activity relationships in this series are discussed and the properties of 2-[[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]thio]-3-phenylquinoline hydrochloride (70) are highlighted."
"The accuracies of indices of left ventricle function were examined in an open-chest model in dogs with and without a ventricular septal defect, in which the ventricular shunt was opened and reclosed by a specially designed flowmeter probe with a cap. The systolic time interval, the maximal rate of pressure development in the left ventricle (+LV dP/dt), +LV dP/dt corrected for the isometric pressure (+LV dP/dt/Pd), and the time to +LV dP/dt (t-dP/dt) were determined by recording the aortic flow, ventricular shunt flow, aortic pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, and left ventricular pressure. The isometric contraction time, the preejectional period, and the ejection time shortened with decrease of the mean aortic pressure and aortic flow, and the mean pulmonary arterial pressure increased after opening the ventricular shunt. When the pulse was varied by atrial pacing, the systolic time interval was affected in dogs both with and without a ventricular septal defect, but "isometric contraction time" was not affected in animals with a ventricular septal defect. Dopamine and methoxamine were used to evaluate the effects of the inotropic state and afterload on these indices. The extents of the changes in the systolic time interval and +LV dP/dt were different in animals with and without a ventricular septal defect, but the changes in preejectional period/ejection time, +LV dP/dt/Pd and t-dP/dt were similar in the two conditions. These results suggest that the systolic time interval and the indices of left ventricular pressure are useful in assessment of cardiac function only in certain conditions."
"The peripheral circulatory effects of alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation with methoxamine hydrochloride were compared with those of alpha 2-stimulation with UK 14304-18 in 12 intact dogs. Doses of each agent were infused to increase systemic vascular resistance and arterial pressure 50 and then 100\% above control. Heart rate was controlled with atropine. At the higher dose, methoxamine increased mean aortic pressure (PAo) from a control of 77.3 +/- 1.6 to 152.9 +/- 3.2 mmHg, mean circulatory filling pressure (MCFP) from 8.0 +/- 0.4 to 13.3 +/- 1.3 mmHg, and central blood volume (CBV) from 21.3 +/- 1.1 to 25.9 +/- 1.5 ml X kg-1, whereas cardiac output did not change. UK 14304-18 increased PAo from 78.1 +/- 2.6 to 148.9 +/- 2.7 mmHg, MCFP from 7.9 +/- 0.4 to 10.6 +/- 0.4 mmHg, and CBV from 21.0 +/- 1.1 to 24.1 +/- 1.5 ml X kg-1, whereas cardiac output decreased from 151.7 +/- 9.4 to 126.3 +/- 5.8 ml X kg-1 X min-1. Mean circulatory filling pressure and CBV were higher with methoxamine than with UK 14304-18. Effective vascular compliance, determined by serial measurements of MCFP during ganglionic blockade after rapid changes in blood volume, decreased from a control value of 1.9 +/- 0.1 to 1.3 +/- 0.3 ml X mmHg-1 X kg-1 with methoxamine, but did not change with UK 14304-18 (1.9 +/- 0.1 ml X mmHg-1 X kg-1). At any given change in blood volume, there was a higher MCFP with alpha 1-stimulation compared with alpha 2-stimulation. Both agents decreased unstressed vascular volume.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Rats were sympathectomized by administering guanethidine from birth through 50 days of age. Experiments were performed in vivo under anesthesia at 18, 25, 40, 60, 70 and 100 days of age to determine if sympathectomy (SNX) attenuated development of vascular noradrenergic contraction and the mechanisms that support mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) after SNX. The maximum and ED50 of the pressor response to the alpha-1 noradrenergic agonist methoxamine was used to test contractility. MAP support mechanisms were assessed indirectly by measuring hypotensive responses to sequential interventions: adrenalectomy, chlorisondamine (ganglionic blockade), phentolamine (alpha-1 and alpha-2 noradrenergic blockade), angiotensin II antagonist, arginine vasopressin antagonist and hydralazine (direct acting vasodilator). Guanethidine abolished the pressor response to tyramine-evoked norepinephrine release, decreased plasma norepinephrine 70\% without change in epinephrine and decreased methoxamine ED50. Maxima of methoxamine pressor responses were comparable in sympathectomized rats and controls at all ages. Resting MAP was 7 to 20\% lower in sympathectomized rats, but MAP after eliminating autonomic nerve influences was 27 to 36\% higher. SNX abolished hypotensive responses to chlorisondamine and decreased responses to phentolamine. In contrast, there were increased responses to angiotensin II antagonist (70-240\%), arginine vasopressin antagonist (250\%) and hydralazine (50-300\%). SNX did not change MAP measured after maximum dilation with hydralazine. We conclude that in rats sympathectomized from birth vascular noradrenergic contraction and intrinsic resistance develop normally, blood pressure is independent of circulating catecholamines from the adrenal or other sources although the vasculature is supersensitive and blood pressure support depends on an enhanced pressor influence of nonadrenergic vasoactive substances including angiotensin II and arginine vasopressin."
"Isolated rings of rabbit thoracic aorta were mounted in tissue baths for the measurement of isometric contraction, and the effects of combinations of two agonists were studied. Concentrations of methoxamine, clonidine, norepinephrine (NE), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and potassium causing threshold contraction (0.1 g) were determined. Combinations of any two of these or of two doses of the same agonist elicited far greater than additive contractions ranging from 0.5 to 2.7 g. When dose-response curves to an alpha adrenergic agonist were obtained in the presence of a threshold concentration of the same or another alpha agonist, the curve was shifted to the left at threshold but converged with the control curve between ED10 and ED70. When 5-HT dose-response curves were obtained in the presence of either NE or methoxamine, the curve was shifted to the left in a parallel fashion. Both NE and methoxamine dose-response curves were also shifted to the left in a parallel fashion in the presence of 5-HT. The threshold concentration of potassium caused leftward parallel shifts of the dose-response curves for all agonists studied. These observations are consistent with the conclusion that the resting state of the rabbit thoracic aorta differs from the threshold contractile state and that this accounts for the far greater than additive contraction caused by combinations of two threshold doses of the same or different agonists. The first dose delivers sufficient stimulus to move the tissue from resting to threshold contractile state whereas the stimulus delivered by the second dose manifests entirely as contraction. This phenomenon affects primarily the threshold response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Arterial blood pressures were measured simultaneously in the thoracic and abdominal aortas in the same conscious rats. Intravenous administration of sodium nitroprusside caused a greater fall in systolic blood pressure in the abdominal aorta than in the thoracic aorta, whereas intravenous administration of methoxamine caused a greater rise in systolic blood pressure in the thoracic aorta. Hence baroreflex sensitivities derived from these data (by relating systolic blood pressure to the pulse interval of the succeeding beat) were appreciably different depending on the site of measurement. The changes in diastolic and mean arterial blood pressures induced by the drugs were similar at the two recording sites. It is suggested therefore that cardiac baroreflex sensitivity should be assessed in conscious rats by relating pulse interval to mean arterial blood pressure recorded at a site other than the thoracic aorta since cannulation at that site impairs baroreflex responsiveness."
"The left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relation has received intense interest as a relatively load-insensitive measure of cardiac performance. In clinical studies, pharmacologic manipulation of blood pressure has been used to determine this relation. Since previous studies have shown that acute changes in the resistance and impedance of the arterial circulation influence the left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relation, the use of vasoactive drugs in its determination may affect the results achieved. This study was undertaken to determine whether clinically used vasoactive drugs influence the left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relation. Sixteen dogs were previously instrumented with micromanometer pressure transducers and three sets of piezoelectric crystals to permit determination of left ventricular pressure and volume. The dogs were studied after autonomic blockade and sedation. End-systolic pressure-volume relations were generated by caval occlusion at control levels of blood pressure, after infusion of a vasopressor (methoxamine, n = 6; angiotensin II, n = 10), and then after infusion of nitroprusside. A composite end-systolic pressure-volume relation was also constructed with the use of control, vasopressor, and vasodilator points in each dog. Angiotensin II resulted in a leftward shift in the relation (Vo decreased from 14.32 +/- 7.3 to 8.04 +/- 10.4 ml, p less than .05) with no significant effect on slope. Methoxamine shifted the relation to the left (Vo decreased from 13.98 +/- 8.74 to -0.47 +/- 12.06 ml, p less than .05) and also reduced the slope (5.41 +/- 3.09 vs 8.28 +/- 3.94 mm Hg/ml, p less than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) is a frequently used clinical index of left ventricular afterload. However, SVR may not adequately assess left ventricular afterload (i.e., ventricular internal fiber load during systole) since it reflects only peripheral vasomotor tone. In contrast, left ventricular end-systolic wall stress (sigma es) reflects the combined effects of peripheral loading conditions and left ventricular chamber pressure, dimension, and wall thickness. To determine the relationship between SVR and sigma es, left ventricular afterload and contractility were pharmacologically altered in eight dogs instrumented with central aortic microtip and Swan-Ganz thermodilution catheters. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and dimensions were measured from two-dimensionally targeted M mode echocardiograms. Aortic, right atrial, and left ventricular end-systolic pressures as well as cardiac output were recorded. SVR and sigma es were determined under control conditions as well as during infusions of nitroprusside, methoxamine, dobutamine, and norepinephrine. Control data acquired before each drug infusion were similar. When compared with baseline values, SVR underestimated the magnitude of change in left ventricular sigma es by 22\% when afterload alone was decreased (nitroprusside), 54\% when afterload alone was increased (methoxamine), and 50\% when afterload was decreased and contractility was augmented (dobutamine). Most importantly, when afterload was minimally decreased in association with augmented contractility (norepinephrine), SVR increased by 21\% while sigma es fell by 9\%. Thus, discordant changes in left ventricular afterload (i.e., sigma es) and SVR can occur during pharmacologic interventions. SVR is an unreliable index of left ventricular afterload, reflecting only peripheral arteriolar tone rather than left ventricular systolic wall force. This emphasizes the fact that a true measure of left ventricular afterload must consider the interaction of factors internal and external to the myocardium."
"N-Substituted trimethylsilylcarbamates were tested as derivatizing reagents for gas chromatographic analysis. N,N-Dimethyltrimethylsilylcarbamate was found to be a suitable agent for direct trimethylsilylation of the salts of alkaloids without previous liberation of the bases. N-Methoxy-N,O-bistrimethylsilylcarbamate was found to react simultaneously and quantitatively with the hydroxy and keto groups of steroids, resulting in the corresponding methoxime trimethylsilyl derivatives."
"To elucidate the relationship between responses in sympathetic outflow to incremental changes in blood pressure, we performed baroreflex activation experiments in conscious, stroke-prone, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. We gave incremental bolus injections of nitroprusside and methoxamine and measured mean blood pressure (MAP), heart rate, and splanchnic nerve activity (SpNA). Change in heart rate per change in blood pressure was greater in WKY rats than in SHRSP indicating the decrease in baroreceptor sensitivity displayed in the latter strain. In contrast, change in SpNA per change in blood pressure was greater in SHRSP than in WKY rats. These findings suggest that sympathetic outflow in SHRSP is more reactive to blood pressure changes than in WKY rats. The discordance in heart rate and SpNA changes supports the notion that central neural integration of autonomic function in SHRSP is impaired."
"We examined the acute effects of ethanol consumption on circulatory responses to the cold pressor test, to handgrip exercise and to intravenous infusion of methoxamine in eight normal male subjects. Ethanol consumption reduced systolic blood pressure responses to the cold pressor test and to handgrip exercise and depressed both systolic and diastolic blood pressure responses to infusion of methoxamine. The depressant effects of ethanol on blood pressure responses to methoxamine were considerably greater than the effects on the cold pressor test and handgrip exercise. Catecholamine concentrations during the cold pressor test and handgrip exercise were not significantly different with or without prior ethanol consumption. Alcohol has been shown to have an acute hypotensive action with all the stimuli."
"In the rat isolated perfused kidney, 2-chloroadenosine and L-N6-phenyl-isopropyl adenosine (L-PIA) produced a modest vasodilatation. After kidneys had been pretreated with methoxamine (to elevate vascular tone) and forskolin (to activate adenyl cyclase and reduce vascular tone), both purine agonists produced vasoconstriction at low doses and vasodilatation at higher doses. This was consistent with the working hypothesis that vasoconstriction resulted from activation of A1-purinoceptors mediating adenyl cyclase inhibition and vasodilatation from activation of A2-purinoceptors stimulating adenyl cyclase. These kidney preparations also demonstrated a marked potentiation of purine-mediated vasoconstriction in the presence of various concentrations of 8-p-sulpho-phenyltheophylline (8-SPT), a drug reported in the literature to be a competitive antagonist of A1- and A2-purinoceptors. Maximal renal vasoconstriction to 2-chloroadenosine and L-PIA was observed in the presence of 10 mM 8-SPT; the fact that this vasoconstriction was sensitive to the selective A1-receptor antagonist 8-(2-amino-4-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dipropylxanthine (PACPX) and that the order of potency of agonists for this effect was L-PIA greater than 2-chloroadenosine greater than D-PIA greater than N6-ethylcarboxamide adenosine (NECA) was consistent with activation of vascular A1-purinoceptors. While these data are consistent with the hypothesis that purines activate vascular A1- and A2-receptors in the rat isolated kidney, the nature of the results did not allow definitive classification of the receptors mediating the purine effects."
"We clarified that the set of the isotropic component (T) of wall tension and the area (A) of a selected region of the left ventricular wall expresses the regional work with sufficient accuracy. The area surrounded by the locus of the T-A relation in the T-A plane is approximately equal to the real work done by that region. The behavior of the T-A loop was studied in nine anesthetized dogs under various conditions. The regional area and diameter of the left ventricle were measured with ultrasonic crystal pairs. The wall tension was calculated from measured left ventricular pressure and diameter by a generalized Laplace's equation for a thick-walled model. During volume loading, administration of methoxamine, and aortic constriction, the regional work per stroke increased with the increase in end-diastolic regional area, which is considered to be the regional Frank-Starling mechanism. With the development of ischemia, the T-A loop for the ischemic region shifted to the right and the work done by that region decreased. After a certain stage in the development of ischemia, the work done by the ischemic region became negative. When only one of the segmental lengths, rather than the area, is measured, difficulty arises in the physical interpretation of pressure-length or tension-length data in some cases. The T-A loop diagram resolves such difficulty by defining the regional work correctly. We conclude that the T-A loop diagram is a useful tool for analyzing the regional ventricular function."
"Two experiments were conducted to determine the effect of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), phenylephrine and ergonovine on uterine contractions. In the first experiment, ewes were bilaterally ovariectomized, and a strain gauge force transducer was sutured to the serosa of one uterine horn. Each ewe was treated sc with 2 micrograms of estradiol-17 beta daily to prevent regression of the uterus. Beginning at least 5 d after ovariectomy, four dose levels of PGF2 alpha, phenylephrine and methoxamine were given by im injection and ergonovine was given by im or iv injection. Phenylephrine, methoxamine and ergonovine are alpha-adrenoceptor agonists. Uterine activity was recorded by physiograph for 30 min before and 90 min after treatment. Tracing were analyzed for 20-min periods before treatment and 4 to 24 min and 50 to 70 min after treatment. In Exp. 2, transducers were attached to uteri of intact ewes at d 10 to 12 of an estrous cycle. During subsequent estrus, one or two dose levels of PGF2 alpha, phenylephrine and ergonovine were given by im injection and uterine activity recorded. In Exp. 1, PGF2 alpha and phenylephrine increased (P less than .05 or .01) the number of amplitude of contractions at both 4 to 24 and 50 to 70 min. Ergonovine given im increased the number of contractions. In intact estrous ewes, PGF2 alpha increased the number and amplitude of contractions at 4 to 24 min, phenylephrine increased the number and amplitude at both 4 to 24 and 50 to 70 min, and ergonovine increased the number slightly but significantly at 4 to 24 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Two different electrophysiological responses in amphibian sympathetic ganglia were studied by means of the sucrose gap technique; the potassium-activated hyperpolarization (KH) which serves as an index of electrogenic Na+ pumping, and the hyperpolarization induced by adrenaline (AdH). Under appropriate experimental conditions, 0.1 microM adrenaline potentiated the KH to 121.5 +/- 7.5\% of control (n = 7). This potentiation was blocked by both yohimbine (50 nM) and prazosin (1 microM) but not by propranolol (1 microM). Clonidine (10 nM) potentiated the KH to 113.5 +/- 3.4\% of control (n = 5), whereas methoxamine (0.1 microM) was ineffective. Several lines of evidence argued against the hypothesis that the AdH may be generated, in whole or in part, by stimulation of the Na+ pump. For example, the AdH was sometimes completely unaffected when the KH was blocked by ouabain, and the AdH was eliminated by 2 mM Ba2+ even though this cation enhanced membrane hyperpolarization accompanying electrogenic Na+ pumping. These results imply that the electrogenic Na+ pump is not involved in the short-term electrophysiological effects of catecholamines. Despite this, it is possible that the homeostasis of Na+ and K+ in nerve may be regulated by alpha-adrenergic mechanisms."
"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) techniques are intended to revive those who experience an unexpected respiratory or circulatory catastrophe. The skills of CPR are reviewed for the surgeon, whose patients may need this assistance. Advances in the basic understanding, techniques, teaching, and practice of CPR have led to the saving of countless lives."
"Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) has been confirmed to be an accurate method for determining left ventricular function. It is a relatively non-invasive technique without inducing premature ventricular complexes. The response of left ventricular function to afterload stress was assessed using DSA for eight patients with old anterior myocardial infarction and ventricular aneurysm including that of the anterior wall (averaging 30.3 months after the acute episodes). Their ages ranged from 36 to 65 years and one patient was a woman. Prior to the investigation, we confirmed that a single DSA procedure did not alter left ventricular function in a pilot study of one patient (No. 8). After initial DSA in the basal state, methoxamine was infused intravenously (1 to 2 mg/min). When aortic systolic blood pressure increased by 30 to 50 mmHg, a second DSA was performed for each patient. Left ventricular volumes and ejection fractions were calculated by the area-length method, and regional wall motion was assessed by the visual method according to the AHA classification and the curvature radius of the apical ventricular aneurysm was calculated. Methoxamine induced neither acute heart failure nor angina pectoris in the present series. The heart rates decreased, and there were a significant increase in end-systolic volumes (p less than 0.05), end-systolic radii (p less than 0.05), and a significant decrease in ejection fractions (p less than 0.02) after methoxamine infusion. In 32 of 40 segments, regional wall motion was unchanged by methoxamine as assessed by the visual method; whereas, in the other eight, there was a deterioration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"A single dose of vinblastine (3 mg/kg, i.v.) in the rat produced a long lasting depletion of endogenous (-)noradrenaline (NA) in atria as well as in vasa deferentia, the depletion being greater in atria than in vasa deferentia. The maximum depletion of NA in atria occurred between 60 and 90 h after vinblastine, while in vasa deferentia the maximum depletion was 35\%, 120 h after vinblastine. The 30 min in vitro uptake of (-)-(3H) NA in atria was inhibited between 78 and 83\% at 30, 60 and 120 h after vinblastine. In vasa deferentia the maximum inhibition of 25\% was seen 15 h after vinblastine, however the NA uptake had returned to control level between 60 and 120 h after vinblastine. The effect of vinblastine pretreatment on the sensitivity of atria to NA and (-)isoprenaline(ISOP), and of vasa deferentia to NA, (-)phenylephrine (PHE), and methoxamine (ME) was evaluated. It was found that atria became highly sensitive to the (+) chronotropic effect of NA without significant change in sensitivity to ISOP. The sensitivity of vas deferens to NA and PHE was moderately increased without significantly affecting the sensitivity to ME. The magnitude of the supersensitivity was expressed in terms of the ratio of the geometric mean ED50 of an agonist in control tissue to that obtained in the same tissue from treated animals. The sensitivity of atria to NA increased 1.5, 3.9, 7.8, and 6.7 fold, 15, 30, 60 and 120 h after vinblastine, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Human atherosclerotic fibrous plaques display a clonal character similar to many benign neoplasms. We report here that chickens treated with an initiation-promotion sequence developed focal intimal smooth muscle lesions in the thoracic aorta that resemble early forms of atherosclerosis. Scanning electron microscopy revealed small mound-like lesions protruding from an intact endothelium in birds treated with an initiating dose of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (Me2BA) followed by twice weekly injections of the alpha 1-selective adrenergic agonist methoxamine for 20 weeks. Intimal lesion foci were composed of densely packed modified smooth muscle cells, abundant extracellular matrix, and occasional mononuclear cells (possibly monocytes). There was no ultrastructural evidence of lipid accumulation or alteration of the underlying media. These intimal lesions appeared in aortic segments of treated chickens in a pattern similar to that observed in classical experiments of multistage tumorigenesis in epidermis and other tissues. The treatment with Me2BA followed by methoxamine produced more focal lesions per thoracic segment and more segments per group with lesions than did treatment with either Me2BA or methoxamine alone. Thoracic intimal foci were absent from untreated and vehicle-treated groups. In contrast, the growth of a spontaneously arising atheroma in the distal abdominal aorta was not demonstrably affected by the initiation-promotion regimen. Likewise, weekly injections of Me2BA for 23 weeks, while greatly enhancing abdominal atheroma growth, produced no thoracic lesions. These results provide evidence that focal proliferation of intimal smooth muscle cells, a critical early event in atherogenesis, can be produced by an initiation-promotion treatment sequence."
"Two experiments were conducted to determine if selection for growth altered the response to intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of methoxamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Lines of chickens divergently selected over 25 generations for 8-week body weight were used. The ICV injection of methoxamine into fully fed birds significantly increased food intake in the high-weight line but had no effect on food intake in the low-weight line. Conversely, the ICV injection of 5-HT had no effect in fully fed birds but significantly decreased food intake in 24-hr fasted birds in both weight-lines. Food intake was affected by 5-HT for a much longer period in the high-weight line than in the low-weight line. These results suggest that selection for growth alters the brain response to biogenic amines."
"Left ventricular dysfunction reduces the ability of the heart to maintain forward output when subjected to the additional stress of an increased vascular resistance. To determine the extent to which hearts from rats with both hypertension and myocardial infarction are sensitive to increases in vascular resistance, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar rats (NWR) with and without myocardial infarction (coronary artery ligation) were infused with methoxamine (0.08 to 1.6 mg/kg/min). Mean arterial pressure during methoxamine infusion was significantly lower in infarcted rats than in noninfarcted rats in each strain, due largely to a lower cardiac output in infarcted rats. When compared at equal pressures, the infarcted groups of each strain generated a lower cardiac output than did the respective noninfarcted groups, as a result of both a lower stroke volume and heart rate. During the methoxamine infusion, absolute pressure levels in SHR with large infarcts were similar to those in NWR. Thus, infarcted hearts from both hypertensive and normotensive rats, when subjected to the stress of an increase in vascular resistance, demonstrated an impairment of pumping ability that was related to the extent of left ventricular damage. Impaired pressure-generating capacity was most pronounced in SHR with large infarcts, which were unable to generate hypertensive levels of blood pressure."
"Pressure-volume relationships in the right atrium were examined before and after the creation of acute experimental tricuspid regurgitation in pigs. A 1.3 kHz multielectrode impedance catheter with a measuring current of 4 mA was used to determine instantaneous right atrial pressure and relative blood volume; right atrial dimension was assessed simultaneously with ultrasonic crystals attached to the atrial walls. Impedance volume waveforms and ultrasonic crystal dimensions closely paralleled each other at baseline and after the induction of tricuspid regurgitation. The normal right atrial pressure-volume plot exhibited a figure-of-eight configuration, with an "a-loop" and a "v-loop" corresponding to the a-wave and v-wave of the right atrial pressure tracing. With severe tricuspid regurgitation, atrial pump function was abolished, and the pressure-volume plot exhibited a single clockwise loop, consistent with complete ventricularization of the right atrium. Intermediate degrees of tricuspid regurgitation preserved the figure-of-eight loop, but the size of both the a-loop and the v-loop were increased, consistent with a Starling-type load imposed on the atrium by the regurgitant blood volume. Increased right ventricular afterload mediated by constriction of the pulmonary artery and infusion of methoxamine reversibly converted the right atrial pressure-volume loop from that of mild to that of severe tricuspid regurgitation. Alternatively, constriction of the inferior vena cava and infusion of nitroprusside changed the right atrial pressure-volume loop from that of a severe pattern of tricuspid regurgitation to a less severe type of pattern. Infusion of dobutamine increased the size of the a-loop relative to the v-loop both at baseline and after induction of tricuspid regurgitation. We conclude that tricuspid regurgitation induces changes in right atrial mechanics that can be detected and quantified with an impedance catheter."
"Alterations in afterload may occur during acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but it is unknown whether such alterations cause long-term changes in the left ventricular topography or alter healing of the AMI. AMI was produced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery in open-chest dogs. Eight dogs were randomized to a methoxamine group with an infusion dose of 30 micrograms/kg/min starting 1 hour after ligation for 4 hours to increase systemic systolic pressure by 40 to 50 mm Hg, and 8 were randomized to a saline control group (n = 8). Seven days later the dogs were killed and the hearts examined. The ratio of infarct wall thickness to noninfarct wall thickness was 1.13 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- standard error of the mean) in control dogs and was 0.98 +/- 0.03 in the dogs treated with methoxamine (p less than 0.005). An expansion index was determined as previously reported and expansion was considered to have occurred if this index exceeded 1.09. The expansion index was 0.98 +/- 0.06 in the control group and 1.18 +/- 0.07 in the methoxamine group (p less than 0.05). Histologic analysis suggested a lag in the healing rate in the methoxamine-treated dogs. Thus, early, brief increases in afterload cause infarct expansion and thinning and appears to slow the early healing phase of AMI in dogs."
"The measurement of left ventricular (LV) function is frequently performed in unconscious or thoracotomised animals in the resting state; these conditions may seriously affect the basal haemodynamic state. To assess myocardial function in conscious animals, a technique was developed to place a catheter across the atrial septum into the left ventricle without a thoracotomy. A stress ventricular function test (SVFT) was performed by raising the systemic blood pressure with methoxamine in the conscious dog. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the SVFT in the detection of a decrease in ventricular function, a SVFT was performed before and after the acute infusion of verapamil to determine resting and reserve LV function. A slope relating systolic aortic pressure to the LV end-diastolic pressure was obtained in 10 dogs using a low dose (0.005) and in four dogs a high dose (0.01 microgram X kg-1 X min-1) verapamil (V). The mean slope before V was 3.6 +/- 1.2 and after 2.0 +/- 0.92 (p less than 0.001). The day-to-day variability of the SVFT was less than 22\% (coefficient of variability). The SVFT is a sensitive, reproducible method to assess resting and increased or decreased myocardial contractility and is useful in selecting appropriate doses of cardiac drugs to determine their effect on the myocardium during acute and chronic infusion studies in the conscious, nonthoracotomised dog."
"Twenty-nine healthy volunteers participated in an experiment lasting for 8 weeks: Phase I (2 weeks)--pre-treatment control period; Phase II (4 weeks)--medication with either ciclazindol hydrochloride (50 mg twice daily), or desipramine hydrochloride (50 mg twice daily) or lactose placebo (twice daily) administered in a single-blind fashion; Phase II (2 weeks)--recovery. Experimental sessions took place twice weekly for the photographic assessment of resting pupil diameter, and for the assessment of one of the following pupillary responses: mydriatic response to methoxamine, mydriatic response to tyramine, miotic response to pilocarpine. Resting pupil diameter increased during medication with either ciclazindol or desipramine. Methoxamine-evoked mydriasis and tyramine-evoked mydriasis were antagonized by both ciclazindol and desipramine. Pilocarpine-evoked miosis was potentiated by both ciclazindol and desipramine. The steady-state plasma levels (mean +/- s.e. mean) of the antidepressants were: ciclazindol: 5.90 +/- 0.74 microM; desipramine: 0.60 +/- 0.17 microM. The antagonism of methoxamine-evoked mydriasis is likely to reflect the blockade of postsynaptic alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the iris by the antidepressants, whereas the antagonism of tyramine-evoked mydriasis may reflect both the blockade of uptake of tyramine into presynaptic adrenergic terminals and the blockade of postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors. There is no immediate explanation for the potentiation of pilocarpine-evoked miosis by the two antidepressants."
"Calcium-tolerant myocytes were isolated from rat hearts. Isoproterenol produced a dose-dependent increase in glycerol output (lipolysis) that could be blocked by propranolol. The presence of glucose in the incubation medium enhanced the release of glycerol from myocytes but had no effect on the decline in triacylglycerol content. No incorporation of radioactivity from [U-14C]glucose into glycerol could be detected. In incubations with isoproterenol, there was a stoichiometric relationship between the glycerol output and the decrease in triacylglycerol levels. The addition of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine resulted in an increase in the basal glycerol output and an enhancement of the isoproterenol-stimulated lipolytic rate. Forskolin and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate also produced a concentration-dependent stimulation of lipolysis in myocytes. Therefore, lipolysis in isolated myocytes must be regulated by adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate-dependent mechanisms. These results demonstrate that lipolysis can be observed in myocardial cells and that the lipolytic response to isoproterenol cannot be secondary to a physiological (inotropic) response since these myocyte preparations are quiescent."
"Administration of the methionine analogue methoxinine (O-methyl-DL-homoserine) to sheep substantially changed the composition of wool; in addition wool fibres were weakened and the staple crimp frequency was reduced for a prolonged period. The proportions of high-tyrosine proteins were reduced by 40-45\% whereas the high-sulfur proteins were usually slightly increased. The content of high-tyrosine proteins in wool was still depressed in most sheep 70 days after dosing with methoxinine. These experiments supported a previous finding that the cystine content of wool and its crimp frequency are not causally related. Ethionine, another methionine analogue, did not consistently change the composition of wool. In some sheep there was no change in the proportions of high-tyrosine proteins following administration of ethionine, even though weak wool was produced. This result, together with the lack of association between the content of high-tyrosine proteins and the strength of wool fibres in a sheep given methoxinine plus methionine, indicates that a reduction of the high-tyrosine proteins is not a prerequisite for the production of weak wool. Neither a threefold increase in the phenylalanine intake by mice nor the administration of three analogues of phenylalanine (4-fluoro-DL-phenylalanine, 4-chloro-DL-phenylalanine and beta-(2-thienyl)-DL-alanine) to sheep altered the composition of hair or wool. Fluorophenylalanine was incorporated into all the constituent proteins of wool to the extent of c. 2\% of phenylalanine residues. The other analogues studied could not be detected in wool."
"The role of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in postnatal functional maturation of Müller's smooth muscle was evaluated in urethane-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. Guanethidine treatment beginning at birth induced complete sympathectomy, as determined by abolition of contractile responses to electrical stimulation of preganglionic axons and tyramine. Through 45 days of age, sympathectomy had little effect on development of contractile responses to stimulation of alpha-1 adrenoceptors by methoxamine. In contrast, sympathectomy prevented the 2-fold increase in contractile response which normally occurs between 45 and 70 days. Similarly, treated preparations were supersensitive to methoxamine (decreased ED50) only after 45 days. Neonatal decentralization of sympathetic neurons also prevented the increase in methoxamine response occurring after 45 days. Treatment of mature rats with guanethidine from 70 to 100 days of age resulted in a 40\% reduction in force of contraction. It is concluded that: the SNS is not obligatory for Müller's muscle functional maturation through 45 days; the SNS mediates a 2-fold increase in contractile response between 45 and 70 days; the effect of the SNS is impulse-dependent; and the intact SNS is required to maintain end organ function at mature levels."
"The effects of isoproterenal (ISP) and methoxamine (MTX) infusion in 20 asymptomatic subjects with labile T wave were studied. In those treated with ISP the T wave showed an early negative trend and later became clearly positive in 5 subjects. In the majority of the subjects treated with MTX the T wave became positive. T wave changes match variations of both the ventricular gradient and, to a lesser degree, the QRS area. These changes were not related to heart rate or, in the subjects treated with MTX, to the baroreceptorial sensitivity deduced from the slope of the regression equation between R-R internal and systolic arterial pressure. The results of this study confirm the existence of a neurogenic mechanism affecting the electrocardiographic changes in T wave."
"An intravenous K+-sensitive electrode has been used to monitor plasma [K+] changes induced by alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor agonists in anaesthetized guinea-pigs, rabbits and rats. The effects of phentolamine and propranolol on these responses were studied. In the guinea-pig both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor agonists produced a biphasic response consisting of an initial rapid increase in [K+] which was followed, within 1 min, by a fall below baseline. The antagonist studies indicated that in this species both phases of the response could be elicited by either alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor activation. In the rabbit the responses were both slower and smaller than those seen in the guinea-pig and required larger agonist doses. In addition it was found that the increase in plasma [K+] was alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated while the subsequent fall was seen only with beta-adrenoceptor activation. In the rat triphasic changes in plasma [K+] were seen consisting of an initial decrease which was alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated, followed by an increase and then a second fall which was elicited by beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. The increase in plasma [K+] was only slightly reduced by either alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Apamin, a toxin from bee venom which blocks Ca2+-activated K+-channels, was found to block the hyperkalaemic phase of the response in the guinea-pig and rabbit but had no effect in the rat. It is concluded that there are marked species differences in the effects of adrenoceptor agonists on plasma [K+] in vivo."
"The effects of agonists and antagonists, specific for the different adrenoceptor subtypes on the automaticity of cultured ventricular cells from postnatal rat, were studied. Chronotropic responses were assessed by recording monophasic action potentials using intracellular microelectrodes. Contraction was assessed by an electro-optical procedure. (-)-Isoproterenol, salbutamol, (-)-phenylephrine, and methoxamine increased the spontaneous rate in a dose-dependent manner, but the stimulatory potencies of alpha-adrenoceptor agonists were weaker than those of the beta-alternates. The frequency response to (-)-isoproterenol was inhibited by atenolol but not by butoxamine. Atenolol was also more effective than butoxamine in antagonizing the rate acceleration by salbutamol. The chronotropic effects of phenylephrine and methoxamine were inhibited by prazosin. In contrast, neither clonidine nor yohimbine displayed any chronotropic action. These findings suggest that the postjunctional adrenoceptors present in the sarcolemma of the isolated cardiac muscle cells, which mediate automaticity responses to catecholamines, are of beta 1, beta 2, and alpha 1 types, the physiological contribution of the beta 1-adrenoceptors being predominant. Applicability of these conclusions to the in situ myocardiocytes is discussed with respect to the level of functional differentiation achieved by the rat myocardial cells in culture."
"Phonocardiography (and auscultation) provide many accurate diagnoses of valvular heart diseases, when they are fully developed and give rise to a typical murmur. Echocardiography displays its mechanism, in most cases (leaflet thickening, ruptured chordae tendinae, vegetations, prolapse). Assessment of their severity is based on analysis of the systolic time intervals on the one hand, and on echocardiographic measurements on the other, i.e., internal dimensions of the heart chambers, wall thickenesses and motions. When necessary, acute pharmacologic interventions permit the diagnosis (positive and differential) of the various types of ventricular outflow tract obstructions (mild or severe), of mild, atypical or "masquerading" regurgitations and of the "innocent" murmurs. They are easier to carry out and to interpret on the basis of phonocardiographic than echocardiographic recordings. Hence the advisability of using both diagnostic methods, as each provides specific data which often support, and always complete one another."
"To determine the usefulness of pulsed Doppler echocardiography (PDE) in diagnosing aortic regurgitation (AR), the following two studies were performed. PDE and phonocardiography (PCG) were evaluated for the diagnosis of AR in 36 patients for whom angiography was performed. In 24 patients with grade 2 to 4 by Sellers' classification, all PDE studies were positive for AR (sensitivity of 100\%) and PCG studies were positive in 21 patients (sensitivity of 88\%). Among 10 patients of grade 1, PDE studies were positive for eight (sensitivity of 80\%) and PCG studies were positive for seven (sensitivity of 70\%). Angiography was negative for AR in two PCG-proven cases, and PDE also proved AR in one of these. Thus, in all patients, the sensitivity of PDE and PCG were 94 and 82\%, respectively. These results indicate that AR may be missed during auscultation, or even when using the latest type PCG. The ability of detecting silent AR was studied in 160 consecutive patients with AR. PDE was positive for AR in 156 of 160 consecutive patients who were diagnosed as having AR by PDE or PCG. In the remaining four patients, three were diagnosed by PCG alone and one by pharmacodynamic phonocardiography using methoxamine (ME-PCG). On the other hand, in 137 of 160, Ar was proven by PCG, and the remaining 23 were so-called "silent AR". ME-PCG was performed for 11 cases of silent AR, but an unequivocal AR murmur was detected in only five. Therefore, the sensitivity of PDE in diagnosing silent AR was 96 percent, while that of ME-PCG was only 45 percent. Thus, compared to PCG and even pharmacodynamic PCG, PDE is a much more sensitive method of diagnosing AR. However, in mild AR cases, angiography, PDE and PCG, all have some limitations in diagnosing AR."
"The specificity of formation of phage f2 RNA-protein complexes was studied. Complex I contains up to 8 mol of coat protein per 1 mol of RNA. Its formation proceeds equally well in medium (i) without magnesium ions, (ii) containing magnesium ions, (iii) containing 4 mM EDTA, and (iv) at temperatures from 0 to 45 C. Complex II contains up to 200 mol of coat protein per 1 mol of RNA. Its formation is inhibited by the presence of magnesium ions in medium. Formaldehyde- or methoxyamine-treated f2 RNA in which only exposed bases were modified showed a normal pattern of complex II formation, whereas formation of complex I was inhibited or abolished. We conclude that complex I formation involves the interaction between coat protein and specific region of exposed bases in RNA. A possible site of attachment of coat protein is discussed."
"To investigate the role of the autonomic nervous system in controlling insulin secretion 13 normal subjects and 5 patients with heart failure underwent insulin secretion tests. Alpha-adrenergic stimulation and beta-receptor blockade significantly depressed the secretion of insulin in response to intravenous tolbutamide in normal subjects, while both alpha-blockade and beta-stimulation significantly increased the insulin secretion response in both normal subjects and patients in heart failure. Parasympathetic stimulation and blockade had no significant effect on the insulin secretion response. These findings suggest that drugs that block the alpha-adrenergic receptors or stimulate the beta-adrenergic receptors by their ability to counteract the insulin suppression resulting from increased sympathetic nervous activity may play a vital metabolic part in the deranged metabolism of the failing heart in addition to their direct haemodynamic benefits."
"1. Uroporphyrinogen I synthetase of Rhodopseudomonas spheroides was purified more than 200-fold from the soluble protein of broken bacterial cells. The enzyme had molecular weight 36000, an isoelectric point of 4.46 and migrated as a single active protein band on disc-gel electrophoresis at pH7.5 and 8.9. 2. The enzyme consumed porphobilinogen and formed uroporphyrinogen at pH8.2 without the accumulation of intermediates. In the presence of hydroxylamine, ammonia or methoxyamine the production of porphyrinogen was inhibited and the enzyme formed open-chain polypyrroles instead. 3. These polypyrroles behaved like uroporphyrinogen on Sephadex G-25; they were colourless and had unsubstituted alpha-pyrrolic positions. The inhibitory amines were incorporated into the molecules. 4. The polypyrroles formed porphyrins non-enzymically and the cyclization reaction was accompanied by the release of the inhibitory amine. Exchange of the amino function of the original porphobilinogen in the polypyrrole was complete with hydroxylamine and almost complete with methoxyamine, both ammonia and methoxyamine being present in the polypyrrolic material. 5. The behaviour, properties and composition of the radioactive hydroxylamine derivative were consistent with a tetrapyrrolic structure, probably a pyrrylmethane, that was not cyclized, rather than with di-, tri- or penta-pyrrolic structures. No monopyrrolic or dipyrrolic Ehrlich-positive material was released on cyclization. The ammonia and methoxyamine derivatives had properties similar to the hydroxylamine derivative. 6. Another modified pyrrole was detected only in experiments with hydroxylamine. It differed from both porphobilinogen and known dipyrroles and appeared to be a monopyrrole. 7. The participation of positively charged reaction centres in the enzymic mechanism, particularly in the cyclization step, is discussed."
"The effects of bilateral carotid artery occlusion (BCO) and carotid sinus nerve stimulation (CSNS) on left ventricular (LV) pressure (P), diameter (D), velocity of contraction (V), rate of change of pressure (dP/dt), and cardiac output were studied in conscious dogs instrumented with ultrasonic diameter gauges, miniature pressure gauges, and aortic electromagnetic flow transducers. The effects of BCO and CSNS were also studied after automatic blockade and were compared to similar alterations in pressure produced by norepinephrine, methoxamine, and nitroglycerin. When heart rate was maintained constant with atrial stimulation, BCO had little effect on ventricular contractility, increasing isolength systolic pressure (LV P(iso)) by 36\% while isolength velocity of myocardial shortening (V(iso)) decreased by 12\% and (dP/dt)/P fell by 8\%. These effects could be explained largely by vasoconstriction, since elevating systolic pressure with methoxamine produced similar results, while norepinephrine increased V(iso) by 36\% and (dP/dt)/P by 56\%. CSNS produced directionally opposite results from BCO; it decreased P(iso) by 15\%, V(iso) increased by 11\%, while (dP/dt)/P remained almost constant. These effects may be explained largely by vasodilatation since reducing systolic pressure to the same level with nitroglycerin produced similar results. When peripheral vasoconstriction was minimized by phenoxybenzamine pretreatment. BCO produced a slight positive inotropic effect (P(iso) increased by 8\%, V(iso) by 4\%, and (dp/dt)/P by 10\%), while CSNS produced a slight negative inotropic effect (P(iso) decreased by 3\%, V(iso) decreased by 5\%, and (dP/dt)/P by 7\%).Thus, in the normal, healthy, conscious dog, the carotid sinuses exert relatively little control of the inotropic state of the left ventricle; moreover, this small inotropic action is masked by the more powerful effects on peripheral resistance."
"In order to characterize the influence of the adrenergic system on pancreatic glucagon secretion in man, changes in basal glucagon secretion during infusions of pure alpha and beta adrenergic agonists and their specific antagonists were studied. During infusion of isoproterenol (3 mug/min), a beta adrenergic agonist, plasma glucagon rose from a mean (+/-SE) basal level of 104+/-10 to 171+/-15 pg/ml, P < 0.0002. Concomitant infusion of propranolol (80 mug/min), a beta adrenergic antagonist, prevented the effects of isoproterenol, although propranolol itself had no effect on basal glucagon secretion. During infusion of methoxamine (0.5 mg/min), an alpha adrenergic agonist, plasma glucagon declined from a mean basal level of 122+/-15 to 75+/-17 pg/ml, P < 0.001. Infusion of phentolamine (0.5 mg/min), an alpha adrenergic antagonist, caused a rise in plasma glucagon from a mean basal level of 118+/-16 to 175+/-21 pg/ml, P < 0.0001. Concomitant infusion of methoxamine with phentolamine caused a reversal of the effects of phentolamine. The present studies thus confirm that catecholamines affect glucagon secretion in man and demonstrate that the pancreatic alpha cell possesses both alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. Beta adrenergic stimulation augments basal glucagon secretion, while alpha adrenergic stimulation diminishes basal glucagon secretion. Furthermore, since infusion of phentolamine, an alpha adrenergic antagonist, resulted in an elevation of basal plasma glucagon levels, there appears to be an inhibitory alpha adrenergic tone governing basal glucagon secretion. The above findings suggest that catecholamines may influence glucose homeostasis in man through their effects on both pancreatic alpha and beta cell function."
"In order to determine whether an adrenergic mechanism is involved in the secretion of growth hormone and insulin, the effect of adrenergic-blocking or -stimulating agents on plasma human growth hormone (HGH), immunoreactive insulin, blood free fatty acids (FFA), and glucose levels was studied in normal human subjects. The intravenous infusion of propranolol, a beta adrenergic-blocking agent, caused a rise in plasma HGH, a transient decrease in blood FFA, and no significant change in plasma insulin. This increase in plasma HGH was inhibited either by the combined administration of isoproterenol, a beta adrenergic-stimulating agent, along with propranolol or by oral glucose loading immediately before the start of propranolol infusion. The concomitant administration of epinephrine and propranolol brought about a rise in plasma HGH comparable with that produced by propranolol alone, without any significant change in blood FFA. Alpha adrenergic blockade by the intravenous infusion of phenotolamine significantly suppressed plasma HGH responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and to arginine infusion, and enhanced plasma insulin response to arginine infusion. It also stimulated lipid mobilization significantly. The intravenous infusion of alpha adrenergic-stimulating agents, phenylephrine and methoxamine, caused an increase in plasma HGH, a slight decrease in blood FFA, and no significant change in plasma insulin. This increase in plasma HGH was significantly inhibited by the simultaneous administration of phentolamine along with methoxamine. On the contrary, a beta adrenergic stimulant, isoproterenol, raised plasma insulin and blood FFA, and abolished the plasma HGH response to propranolol. Another beta stimulator, isoxsuprine, raised blood FFA but not plasma insulin. It is concluded that either beta adrenergic blockade or alpha stimulation enhances HGH secretion and inhibits insulin secretion and fat mobilization, whereas either alpha blockade or beta stimulation stimulates insulin secretion and fat mobilization and inhibits HGH secretion."
